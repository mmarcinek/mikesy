"title": "Titanium Wood Ring Lined With Whiskey Barrel White Oak Stave",
"description": "This ring also comes in Cobalt, which is more scratch resistant and the color of white gold:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/197327996/cobalt-wooden-ring-lined-with-jack\n\nThe inner liner of this ring is made from a genuine used Jack Daniels Whiskey white oak barrel. Almost as much work goes into perfecting the Jack Daniels barrel as does perfecting the iconic American whiskey. Carefully selected American White Oak is slowly dried outdoors for nearly a year. After being exposed to the rain and sun, it is kiln dried, assembled, and then charred to release the naturally occurring flavors that will be imparted to the whiskey. Though the blanks reek of whiskey, the final products (sadly, from an authenticity perspective) have no odor, having been sealed with finish.  \n\nI have a few other barrel wood options besides Jack Daniels, including Jim Beam, Maker&#39;s Mark, and Buffalo Trace. Please see this blog post to see what I mean:\n\nhttp://www.wedgewoodrings.com/blog/2014/4/27/barrel-staves-and-the-many-options-at-our-disposal\n\nJACK DANIEL&#39;S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product!\n\nThe titanium in this wooden ring is 6al-4v grade 5 titanium, preferred among jewelers. The ring pictured is a stone finish, but satin and polished finishes are also available (message for details). \n\nTitanium ring sizes run from 4 to 16 including quarter sizes. I highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size.  &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order.  Include a custom finish/profile in the &quot;note to wedgewoodrings&quot; section at checkout.\n\n+++SEE SHOP ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE SHOP PAGE FOR CURRENT SHIP DATE+++\n\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\n\nThe minimum width for this style is 5mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\n\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\n\nSize 5- 5mm\nSize 7- 6mm\nSize 9- 7mm\nSize 11+- 8mm\n\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nTitanium lined wood rings cannot be resized at all! Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. Refunds and exchanges will not be possible.\n\nPlease click on the &quot;Policies&quot; link (under Shop Info) to see wood ring care instructions and FAQ.\n\nEach ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. This protective coating is sanded up to 12,000 grit for an unbelievable, glass-like finish.\n\nAll rings ship via USPS Priority (or Priority International) Small Flat Rate Box. If you are outside the US and Canada, your only shipping option is Global Express.  Please read below for details.  Insurance is mandatory for this ring, and included in the shipping charge. You pay what I pay for shipping, nothing more.\n\nFor customers outside the US:\n\nDue to changes in USPS policy, international packages sent to countries other than Canada can no longer be tracked past the US border.  Insurance claims are also not possible.  Due to this change and for your protection, international customers outside of Canada will be required to pay for USPS Global Express shipping ($44.95), which in addition to guaranteeing arrival within 3-5 business days (excepting intervention from your country’s customs department), also can be tracked and insured.  I wish I could offer a more economical solution, but cheaper options are too risky.\n\nInternational customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond the original delivery estimates. It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",

"sale_message": "Below are some very important policies that I hope will not be relevant to your order (because they are only relevant when something is wrong). PLEASE READ THEM in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING RETURNS: Every ring is made to order, to the exact size you provide to me.  Rings with a wood interior can be adjusted up or down by about 1/4 size, but beyond that YOUR RING CANNOT BE RESIZED.  Refunds and exchanges will not be possible, as an entirely new ring will have to be made for you.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING MODIFICATIONS: When I receive an order, even though the ship date seems far off (in practice, I often ship early), work begins on your ring immediately.  Within 48 hours, the metal for your ring has very likely already been ordered, and perhaps has already been completed. For this reason, if you need to make a change (size, width, etc.) AFTER 48 hours, there will be a charge of $30.  \r\n\r\nThank you for reading.  This is obviously an automatically generated message.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me through Etsy.  I respond fairly quickly.  If you find these policies overly draconian or otherwise problematic, please contact me as soon as possible so I can, with regret, cancel your order.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSteven Wyatt\r\nWedgeWood Rings",

The current ship date for my rings is always available at the top of my shop in the announcements section. Rush order for Ti rings (15- day turnaround) is available for purchase as well.\r\n\r\nIf you have a specific date by which you need the rings, please email us first to see if this is possible. We will make every effort to get it to you in time!\r\n\r\nAll rings will be shipped domestically via USPS priority mail or priority international.  There are optional express shipping listings as well.  You pay what I pay for shipping, and no more.\r\n\r\nFor customers outside the US:\r\nInternational customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond the original delivery estimates. It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",
"policy_refunds": "You must provide me with an accurate size. The size you order will be the size you receive.  NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES WILL BE POSSIBLE IF YOU PROVIDE ME WITH THE WRONG SIZE.\r\n\r\nIf you order a ring with a wooden inner surface, and it turns out to be a little too big, I can decrease the size slightly.  If i is much too big, or if it is too small no refunds or exchanges will be offered, as a re-size is not possible, and it takes just as much material and time to provide a new ring.\r\n\r\nThe owner is responsible for maintaining the finish. This means scratches on the finish or loss of the glossy finish (issues that can be fixed and prevented with buffing wax) are not covered.  Rings are covered against breaks due to craftsmanship for 6 months - I will replace it for no charge.  If, however, your ring meets a bad end due to an accident (smashing in a door, or any other stresses that no wooden ring could expect to withstand), no refund will be offered. ",
"policy_additional": "**FAQ**\r\n\r\nWhy wooden rings?\r\n\r\n*Plain metal is boring.\r\n\r\n*Nickel allergies are quite common, and wooden rings are a great alternative. The titanium I use is also nickel-free and hypoallergenic.\r\n\r\n*They are beautiful, and no two are the same.\r\n\r\n*They make great gifts – especially for first wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is paper [close enough]) and 5th wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is WOOD)\r\n\r\nHow durable are your rings?\r\n\r\nThe most important factor that determines the durability of these rings is the owner. Each ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. As for the normal wear-and-tear from daily use, the perfect gloss will eventually become scratched (just as with metal rings), but buffing wax occasionally applied will protect the ring and its shine for years.\r\n\r\nThe titanium lined rings are unquestionably significantly stronger than rings made of wood alone. On the Moh’s Hardness Scale, Gold and Silver are around 3, Platinum 4.5, and Titanium is 6.  Any circumstances under which your Titanium is scratched, any precious metal would have been scratched all that more severely.  It is certainly not going to snap.\r\n\r\nPlease use common sense when wearing a ring with a wooden component.  WedgeWood Rings the strongest and most durable wood rings you can buy, but it is still a thin piece of wood you are wearing on your finger.  If you are going to move furniture, take it off first; if you are going to go climbing, do not wear your ring; if you are going to do some landscaping and are moving some rough stones, pocket the ring.\r\n\r\n“Hybrid Epoxy Finish”\r\n\r\nPart shameless marketing term, part description of a secret, painstakingly  brewed combination of epoxy and other finishes, this phrase describes the primary protection for the wood in your ring.  Think boat finish, thats pretty close to the meat of it.  The actual details I wouldnt tell my own mother (sorry mom!).\r\n\r\nSee this post for some more details: http://wedgewoodrings.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/the-promised-big-announcement/\r\n\r\nWhat size am I?\r\n\r\nTitanium ring sizes run from 4 to 16 including quarter sizes. I highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size. &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order. Keep a couple things in mind: your fingers are slightly swollen in the morning (don’t ask me why), your fingers are larger during warm weather, your fingers are larger after a meal (especially salty meals). This means that if you have your finger measured on a chilly evening before dinner, the result will be on the low end of your actual size.\r\n\r\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\r\n\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTitanium lined wood rings cannot be resized at all! Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. Refunds and exchanges will not be possible.\r\n\r\n~~~HOW DO I CARE FOR MY RING?~~~\r\n\r\nWater is no problem, sweat is no problem. Soap, occasional Purell, no problem!  If you work in a medical field, or any other profession that necessitates that your hands come in regular contact with strong solvents, I do NOT recommend you wear your ring while engaging in these activities.  No wood finish can withstand constant contact with solvents!  \r\n\r\nYour ring maintains its protection against water and soap only as long as the finish remains!  If you damage the finish, you must contact me for refinishing, or your ring may be permanently damaged.\r\n\r\nIn terms of maintaining the beauty of the finish, you can apply wax to the wood portions with a cloth. I personally use a suspension of hard and soft waxes in mineral oil (commercially available as butcher block conditioner) because the oil carries the waxes into any scratches that may be present and makes them invisible. It is also the first line of defense against anything harmful to the finish (including the friction with your finger). If you wanted to be extremely conscientious, you could apply it very often, like every few days or so. This sounds insane (and it is not really necessary), but it is literally the work of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWill my ring look just like the picture?\r\n\r\nEach ring is made to order and unique. The appearance will therefore vary according to the individual characteristics of the piece of wood. However, you can be assured that each ring is made to exacting standards of beauty and durability.\r\n\r\nCan I customize my ring?\r\n\r\nThe most common customization requests are width and profile modifications.\r\n\r\nWIDTH: I strive for “normal” proportions. I know that is unhelpful, so here is a rough guide: \r\n\r\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\r\n\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD EXTERIOR style is 4mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD INTERIOR style is 5mm. The maximum is 8mm.\r\n\r\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\r\n\r\nSize 5- 5mm\r\nSize 6 - 5.5mm\r\nSize 7- 6mm\r\nSize 8 - 6.5mm\r\nSize 9- 7mm\r\nSize 10 - 7.5mm\r\nSize 11+- 8mm\r\n\r\nPROFILE: By default, my rings have a lightly sloping dome shape– a traditional ring profile. Some people prefer a flat profile, and that is no problem. Just put your profile requests in the &quot;note to wedgewoodrings&quot; section at checkout.\r\n\r\nEngraving?\r\n\r\nI do not offer engraving for my rings. For the wood exterior rings you can get it engraved, however I do not recommend it. A jeweler can engrave titanium, but I do not know what clamping methods they might use. Because the vast majority of jewelers will be unfamiliar with wood and wood finish, they might damage it. Such damage would absolutely not be covered by warranty.\r\n\r\nWhere do you get your wood?\r\n\r\nExotic wood dealers on Ebay mainly. In some cases, I use found wood. I’ve even been known to raid roadside piles of cutoffs.\r\n\r\nCan you do custom orders using [insert wood/ wood combination here]?\r\n\r\nI certainly can if I have the wood. If I don’t have the wood, I may be able to get it. Send me an email with what you have in mind.\r\n\r\nSome examples of previous orders: ring made from the wood of an old house, ring made with sand from the honeymooners’ beach; ring made from a skateboard; ring made from a tree on the family farm.",

"description": "***** THIS LISTING IS FOR A CUSTOM ENGRAVED BARREL,  UPON RECEIPT OF ORDER, OUR GRAPHICS DESIGNER WILL CONTACT YOU WITHIN 24 HOURS TO DISCUSS YOUR CUSTOM ENGRAVING.  WE WILL ALLOW FOR EDITING UNTIL YOU GIVE US APPROVAL FOR YOUR DESIGN******\n\n\n*******10-liter and 20-liter barrels are currently taking 4-6 weeks for delivery********\n\n\n\nThe time and expense of oak barrel aging at home is now a thing of the past.  Traditionally, barrel aging required 200-liter barrels which are expensive to make and even more expensive to fill up.  Longhorn Barrels come in a variety of sizes, specifically designed for the home-brewer/distiller and micro-brewer/distiller.  By reducing the size of the barrels, you are able age your favorite beverage in smaller batches and with greater frequency due to the reduced aging time required. \n\nEach Longhorn Barrel is handcrafted using 100% American White Oak, responsibly harvested in Missouri, Kentucky and California.  Made to your specifications, we can customize and create a barrel to meet your needs. \n\nUpon receiving your order, an expert artisan cooper will craft your barrel from hand-selected white oak staves secured with galvanized black steel hoops.  Once your barrel is constructed, the interiors are charred and shipped within days.  The charring caramelizes the sugar inside the wood and provides it’s own unique color and depth of flavor. \n\nThe aging process can take as little or as long as you would like.  Normally, 4-6 weeks will deliver ideal results in a 1-liter barrel.  As the barrel size increases, the aging time increases as well.  \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nQ.  What differentiates a premium bourbon from an off-the-shelf bourbon? \n\nA.  More often than not, it’s simply the amount of time aged in charred oak barrels. \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nQ.  How is a Reposado Tequila different than a Anejo Tequila? \n\nA.  Again, it’s the time the product is aged in charred oak barrels. Reposado is aged at least 2 months but no longer than 12 months.  Anejo Tequilas are aged a minimum of 1 year up to a maximum of 3 years. \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nOur American Oak Barrels transform your favorite spirit into a top-shelf version in only a few weeks.  A bottle of Tennessee whiskey (roughly $18.00) is easily transformed into single barrel Tennessee whiskey (roughly $35.00) in a fraction of the time normally required. \n\nThe best part is…YOU determine when it’s ready.  We recommend weekly tastings at a minimum.  If you are happy with the progress, simply filter and drain into the vessel of your choice.  Want the flavors to develop more? Let it age another week and then taste again.  Just remember, once you decide it is ready, remove it from the barrel immediately!\n\nFeeling a little more adventurous?  Check out our recipes for truly amazing cocktails made at home.  Our favorite is the Aged Manhattan, so unbelievably mellow and easy to drink.  If you’re the innovative type, feel free to branch off and create your very own recipe!  We love hearing about our customers&#39; creations.\n___________________________________________________________\n\nIncludes:\n\n    Black Hoop Barrel\n    Barrel Bung\n    Spigot\n    Barrel Cleaning Kit\n    Barrel Stand\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nBarrel Dimensions:\n\n1-liter: 7.75”L x 5”W x 7.25&quot;H\n2-liter: 8.5”L x 5.75”W x 8”H\n3-liter: 10&quot;L x 7&quot;W x 9.25&quot;H\n5-liter: 11.25&quot;L x 7.75&quot;W x 10.75&quot;H\n10-liter: 13.5&quot;L x 10&quot;W x 14&quot;H\n20-liter: 18&quot;L x 12&quot;W x 16.75&quot;H\n\n\n\n*******10-liter and 20-liter barrels are currently taking 4-6 weeks for delivery********\n\n\n***** THIS LISTING IS FOR A CUSTOM ENGRAVED BARREL,  UPON RECEIPT OF ORDER, OUR GRAPHICS DESIGNER WILL CONTACT YOU WITHIN 24 HOURS TO DISCUSS YOUR CUSTOM ENGRAVING.

Please read additional policies pertaining to the submission of images below and let us know if you have any questions or concerns.. LISTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/186169097\r\n\r\nDESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT CUSTOM ARTWORK! Custom made or one of a kind, Design&#39;s the Limit will create a piece of art to your specifications on a piece of glass or mirror to your specified dimensions and ship it to you. We are only limited by the inspiration you provide! Design&#39;s the Limit offers custom made display artwork for your special interest or desire. When you place your order, the non-refundable deposit will allow us to create and submit a design proof and estimate for your approval based on the information and the inspiration you provide. You do not have the rights to reproduce the designs we submit and your deposit is strictly for the time to create your design and estimate the cost of completing and shipping your artwork with Design&#39;s the Limit reserving the rights to the designs which may not be reproduced by others under any circumstances. Design&#39;s the Limit reserves the rights to all of our images and artistic creations as the sole intellectual property of Design&#39;s the Limit, LLC. Reproduction of our images or artwork is strictly prohibited. Every piece of artwork we produce will include a signature (and print number unless created as a one-of-a-kind unique design masterpiece). When specified as a one-of-a-kind design, we will never again reproduce the image we create for you to make your artwork a truly unique artistically inspired design creation. DESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT&#39;S CUSTOM DISPLAY ARTWORK - \r\nMASTERPIECE LISTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/176383600\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETCHED, ENGRAVED, AND CARVED?\r\nWhen it comes to personalizing, there is such a wide variety of artists and styles available that we can not cover them all in this explanation. Design&#39;s the Limit employs a combination and variety of techniques including occasional chemical etching, laser engraving for many items, and sandblasted carving depending on the item, the desired effect, and the customer request. Laser engraving offers many advantages, but has it&#39;s own limitations and sandblasted carving gives a desired effect while delaying completion time and increasing costs. Design&#39;s the Limit offers a sandblasted listing for any glassware purchase and for all customer&#39;s who prefer the method of sandblasting: SANDBLASTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/176565485/sandblast\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY BEER MUG OR COFFEE CUP HANDED? Yes, if you specify that you would like your mug for left handed or right handed orientation Design&#39;s the Limit will fill your order as you have requested at no additional charge. As there is no consensus as to the proper orientation and we often fill orders with engraving on both sides of the mug, we generally complete orders as shown in the main product images. Unless the customer specifies the desired handing at the time of purchase, we reserve the right to complete each order as we see fit depending on the characteristics of the mugs purchased and the design specified. Please let us know if you have any questions or special requests and we would be happy to complete your order to your specifications\r\n\r\nIS THE GLASSWARE DISHWASHER SAFE? They are dishwasher safe, the engraving is permanently engraved, and the designs will not come off. Tatiana and I have a difference of opinion on this matter, as she believes that some dishwashers and some dish detergents will leave small scratches on any glass. She recommends hand-washing with warm water and a soft, non-abrasive sponge. We put a lot of effort into creating our art, so we hand-wash them, but our designs are permanently engraved in the glassware we sell and cannot be removed in the dishwasher. It is the customers responsibility and decision on the method of cleaning the products, but we recommend cleaning thoroughly when you products arrive before use.\r\n\r\nARE THE CUTTING BOARDS FOOD SAFE? The cutting boards and cheese boards are permanently engraved. We like to say the design is already there and just needs to be uncovered. We do not add any product that is not considered food safe to the surface of any of our cutting boards or cheese boards. We recommend cleaning your products thoroughly when they arrive before using and accept no liability for the products we sell. Please read hold-harmless policy below. NOTE: Do not submerge cutting boards or cheese boards in water, surface wash with damp cloth with water only. Do not clean with any substance other than water and do not put in the dishwasher. Submerging wood in water or running through the dishwasher will cause the product to warp or crack and all sales are final. Recommend applying food safe cutting board oil on a semi-regular basis to extend the life of the product.\r\n\r\nARE CRYSTAL GLASSES SAFE? Although generally accepted as safe for use, leaded crystal stemware and decanters pose a significant health risk and proper cleaning and handling instructions should be followed with every use. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends washing thoroughly before and after each use. Design&#39;s the Limit does not recommend storing liquids in the leaded crystal products for longer than needed to entertain and never more than a few hours. Leaded crystal products should be used responsibly by consenting adults only. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends all customers not familiar with leaded crystal products research the subject independently and all customers accept responsibility for the products they purchase and agree to hold Design&#39;s the Limit harmless in accordance with our shop policies. Many of the crystal decanters and crystal stemware we offer are 100% lead free optic crystal and are considered safe for storing liquids in for longer periods of time. Please click &quot;Ask a Question,&quot; if you would like additional information about any other products we sell, but the leaded crystal product listings are identified as such in the product information.\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY PEN OR PENCIL SET HANDED? You can specify handing for a pen or pencil at the time of purchase, but it is not necessary. When you place an order for a pen or pencil with engraving on one side, we engrave your name or information opposite the pen clip. If you specify or purchase engraving on both sides, we engrave your name or information on both sides of the pen or pencil. You can also choose to specify a name on one side of the pen and a job title, company name, or other information on the opposite side of the pen or pencil. Our listing for the metal pen includes three sides which you may choose to have engraved with different information on each side. Design is Limited only by your requests. Design the time to make your personal gift perfectly unique.\r\n\r\nDOES THE TOOTHBOX LID FIT TIGHTLY? Yes, the lid does not fall off if you turn the toothbox upside down and it is perfect for storing teeth and putting under the pillow. To remove the top you have to wiggle or twist is slightly.\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER QUANTITY DISCOUNTS OR OTHER PROMOTIONS: Design&#39;s the Limit offers an increasing percentage discount based on the quantity purchased of any item in our shop. Design&#39;s the Limit also posts coupon codes and special offers on Twitter and our Facebook page and ask all customers to please like and share before using the coupon codes found there. Design&#39;s the Limit will not retroactively issue refunds for quantity discounts, so make sure to use select the appropriate listing for the quantity you wish to purchase, request a custom listing for any quantity over one dozen, and enter the coupon code at the time of purchase. Please click &quot;Request a Custom Order&quot; and we will create a listing for any quantity you wish to purchase if you include your zip code for shipping. All of the products we sell are intended to be used or given as gifts by the customer who purchases them. We do not offer products for wholesale and do not give any of our customers the right or permission to resell any of the items in our shop without contacting us before they place an order. All sales are final and we encourage all of our customers to read the product listings, read our shop policies, and contact us for any questions they may have before making a purchase.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF THE PRODUCT IS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING? Design&#39;s the Limit makes every effort to ensure that your product arrives safely, but occasionally shipping damage does occur. We recommend that all customers open their package as soon as it arrives and contact us if there is any problems with the items you have purchased. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends that all customers select either USPS Priority Mail, USPS Priority Express Mail, or purchase insurance when they place their order. The USPS includes insurance for all USPS Priority Mail and USPS Priority Express Mail shipments, but it is the customers sole responsibility to submit and handle shipping claims directly with the USPS unless additional insurance is included at the time of purchase from either the shipping options drop down menu at checkout or by adding this listing to your shopping cart: INSURANCE LISTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/187324452/insurance. If you purchase additional insurance at the time of purchase, we will require you to a.) Submit multiple pictures of the product and packaging, b.) Complete, sign, and return a statement about the shipping damage, and c.) Store the damaged item until shipping claims can be resolved. Please contact us within 24 hours of receiving your package for any claims.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF AN ITEM WAS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING, BUT I DID NOT PURCHASE SHIPPING INSURANCE WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER? If you elected not to purchase additional shipping insurance or to have your item shipped USPS Priority Mail or USPS Priority Express then you will have to purchase a replacement item from our listings, but Design&#39;s the Limit will still offer you the following: \r\n1.) Upgrade your order to a rush order at no charge and complete your order and ship your replacement without delay. \r\n2.) Upgrade your shipping to USPS Priority Mail at no additional charge even if you select standard shipping at checkout.\r\n3.) Offer you a partial refund when your order is complete to include a discount for the total quantity purchased, refund for shipping overage if possible, and an additional discount depending on the product purchased. \r\nTo qualify for this offer you must contact us within 24 hours of receiving your package and e-mail us pictures of the damaged item and packaging for our records to info@designsthelimit.com. Design&#39;s the Limit makes every effort to package our items to avoid any potential problems as a result of shipping, but can not be held responsible for the safe handling of your package and recommends customers purchase additional insurance or upgrade to USPS Priority Mail with every purchase.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I AM ORDERING MORE THAN ONE OF THE SAME PRODUCT:\r\nWhen ordering more than one of any product we offer, you will notice product variations.. Many products have a distinct character inherent in the materials nature including wood, glass, stone, and other materials. Any product, when purchased, will have individual characteristics due to the nature of the product which are not considered defects. These variations are to be expected, are considered desirable, and give each a unique appeal.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I CHOOSE TO CANCEL MY ORDER: You can request that your order be cancelled from the time of purchase until your item has been personalized. Once an item has been personalized, we can no longer accept a cancellation, but we will refund the shipping charges.

Photos are of an actual barrel with designs superimposed onto the barrel. Barrels ate not printed, they are engraved using a laser burner. ****\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\nHOW ARE THESE MADE:\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\nThese are made using a laser burner, as most custom barrels are.  It is completely normal to have darker areas around the engraved portion of your barrel caused by the laser.  This is not smudging and is meant to give your barrel it&#39;s character. Some barrels will have more than others, but that is what makes each barrel unique and no two barrels alike.  Please love and respect your custom barrels for the unique pieces of art they are and they will love you back ;)  \r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\nPLEASE NOTE PRODUCTION TIMES: Although our normal processing times are typically 3-5 business days for barrels and 4-5 business days for barrel head trays and accessories requiring additional curing time, it can take around 7-10 business days for all orders during the Holidays (primarily Christmas, Father&#39;s Day and Valentine&#39;s Day), during wedding season (summer) and high peak times.  Please be sure to allow enough time for your custom items to be made and account for shipping time when ordering by ordering a few weeks in advance. Rush options are available. Please inquire prior to ordering if needed by a certain date and we can set up a custom listing with rush options if they are needed.  If rush options are not selected, orders are produced in the order they are received regardless of special requests.  This is to be fair to all of our customers since everyone wants their barrel as soon as possible.\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING RATES:\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\nWE DO SHIP WORLDWIDE! IF ORDERING INTERNATIONALLY YOU NEED TO CONTACT US PRIOR TO PLACING YOUR ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ACCURATE SHIPPING QUOTE!  Canadian shipping starts at $29.99 for 1 Liter barrels.

If additional shipping is due, we cannot process your order until all invoices have been settled.\r\nA VALID PHONE NUMBER IS REQUIRED FOR ALL INTERNATIONAL ORDERS.  WE WILL NOT SHIP UNLESS THIS HAS BEEN PROVIDED.

THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE CHARGE OR ARE PAID FOR AT ALL- IT IS THE CARRIER AND/OR GOVERNMENT CHARGING THESE FEES. \r\n\r\nPROBLEMS WITH YOUR ORDER?\r\nPlease email order support at support@customsentiments.com, being sure to reference your Etsy Order number in the subject line of the email. A few good quality photos are required to open an exchange request. Due to the custom nature of our products, we do not offer refunds since once personalized it cannot simply be returned to stock. Please note that since wood is a natural product and not man made, there will be variations in color of wood from barrel to barrel and it may be lighter or darker than depicted in photos.  This is something that cannot be controlled for any wood product, not just barrels. Barrels are engraved using a laser and are not printed.  All true barrels will have a rivet from manufacturing- some more prominent than others no matter where ordered.   We just like to be more up front than most so you know what to expect.  Also note that the barrel rings may have a few &quot;scars&quot;, which is again perfectly normal no matter where you order a true barrel from.  The mentioned do not warrant an exchange.  Just enjoy your unique one of a kind barrel for the unique work of art it truly is and it&#39;ll love you back ;)\r\n====================================================================\r\n\r\n               ✪✪✪✪    BUSINESS HOURS AND HOLIDAY CLOSINGS:   ✪✪✪✪\r\nWe are open M-F 7am- 4:30pm EST and are closed on the weekends and Holidays.  Questions can still be answered on weekends and after hours when we are available.  If nobody is available, your question will be answered on the next business day.  Business days are considered M-F between business hours.  \r\n\r\nWe are closed on all major Holidays and Holiday weekends to allow for us to observe these Holidays with our families.  Although we may be able to answer questions and phone calls on occasion during these times, our stores are not open and we are not in production on the following dates (unless notated):\r\n\r\nNew Years: Dec 31st- January 1st\r\nValentine&#39;s Day: February 13th- February 16th \r\nEaster weekend: April 3rd- April 6th (Good Friday- Easter Monday)\r\nMother&#39;s Day: closed over weekend as usual\r\nFather&#39;s Day: closed over weekend as usual\r\nIndependence Day: July 4th\r\nLabor Day: Sept. 7th\r\nHalloween: closed over weekend as usual\r\nThanksgiving: November 25th-27th\r\nChristmas Eve and Christmas Day: Closed 12/23-12/29 for Christmas Break.

For certain Holidays, Etsy does not seem to automatically account for Holiday closings and may cause a miscalculation in your shipping time frame around these Holidays.  We are unable to change this and unfortunately cannot help this from happening as it is an issue in the Etsy system itself.  If your order shows it will ship on one of the above dates that we are closed, it will be shipped on the next business day.  If your order is placed outside of business hours or on a weekend or Holiday, it will be entered the next business day. Thank you for understanding.\r\n\r\n",

THIS IS FOR YOUR BENEFIT AS IT HELPS PREVENT RETURNED OR UNDELIVERED PACKAGES.  \r\n\r\nSHIPPING RATES:\r\nUSA: Rates shown are for orders shipping to an address within the Continental USA.\r\nALL INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Please contact us to request a shipping quote prior to placing your order so we can give you an accurate shipping quote. \r\nCANADA:  Rates shown are estimates and most Canadian addresses will fall within this shipping cost range if ordering a 1 or 2 liter barrel.  Canadian orders are sometimes higher depending on your location, (MB adn QC tends to be higher than other locations).  We charge the lowest base cost and if the cost is higher, we contact you to give you the opportunity to cancel your order without a cancellation fee or invoice the additional costs.  All invoices must be settled before we will ship your order.  We do this to save more customers money instead of charging a higher base rate across the board since Etsy doesn&#39;t have a way to calculate shipping based on your address yet.  Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\nOur preferred carrier is UPS and most orders over 1 pound will ship using this carrier and orders under a pound by USPS. However, we reserve the right to ship using the most economical carrier for your address unless a specific upgrade has been requested and paid prior.\r\n\r\nUsually ships within 3-5 business days, but can take up to 7-10 business days during our busy time and during Holidays.  Please allow extra time for fully custom items.  If you are in a rush, it is best to order as soon as possible to make sure your item arrives in time.  Holiday processing times will be updated as needed, as these times can change daily.  If you need to expedite your order, you can request a rush order for an additional $35.  Please contact us regarding this prior to purchase.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to check your address for accuracy.  UPS can charge us returned package fees and this is passed on to you if this arises.

"policy_refunds": "Since each item is made to order, like many of our products, we have a no return and no refund policy.  If there is damage during shipping, please alert us and contact the shipping carrier to file your claim.  If we have made an error on your barrel, please send a high quality photo to steve.barrels@customsentiments.com and be sure to reference your Etsy order number in the subject line, describing the issue.  We will review your order and if warranted, offer a free replacement.  We will then send a RMA label for the return of your defective barrel.  The return of the defective barrel is required prior to processing any free exchange.  Once received, we will send you a replacement.  All replacement&#39;s are for the same exact item only, with the same exact personalization, finish, etc. and no changes can be made to your order.\r\n\r\nOrder Changes and Cancellations:\r\nPlease contact us immediately if you need to make a change to your order.  We will do our best to accomodate, but we can in no way guarantee that a change can be made.  It is important to note that once an order is received, it is pre-labeled for shipping with a note regarding personalizations and sent down the production line through several stations.  It can take hours to locate where an order is in the process, which is why we cannot accept any change requests once an order enters the production queue.  Cancellations are not allowed.  Please be sure you are ordering exactly what you want prior to placing an order.  In the event we agree to cancel an order, there is a $35 cancellation fee assessed and you will be refunded the price paid less the cancellation fee.  This is only allowed in rare circumstances and not something we do often.  There is absolutely no cancellations for any custom barrel designs (artwork) as we start the design process shortly after receiving the order. By placing your order with us, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nPlease note that in very rare circumstances (usually around Christmas), we may, at our discretion, substitute for a different hoop color if the wait time for the color you ordered exceeds one week.  This is very rare, but can happen and is something that every barrel company has to deal with from time to time and therefore, this will not warrant a refund or replacement as this cannot be helped. ",
"policy_additional": "DESIGN PROOFS: \r\nWe get asked for design proofs A LOT.  We do not provide design proofs or photos for personalized orders using current designs.  ONLY FULLY CUSTOM designs or large corporate logo orders can request a design proof.  Proofing may be subject to a $25 proof charge so please request a custom listing if you would like to add a design proof.  Your proof includes one small revision if necessary, as well as one revised proof.  Proofs are not photographs of the actual barrel. This will be a design proof.  \r\n\r\nCan I use my OWN PHOTO OR LOGO?  \r\nYes, absolutely!  We do have a few rules on this though:\r\n1) Your image must be complete and ready to engrave, meaning:\r\n  a. It must be high quality\r\n  b. It must be 100% black and white (black is what gets engraved).\r\n  c. It must be complete with all text, imagery, etc. and not need any editing on our part.  If any changes, modifications, additions or other editing is needed, there may be additional cost for this service.\r\n  \r\n2) We cannot use copyrighted images.  If you are wanting to use a college logo, permission is usually pretty easy to obtain from your school, but we cannot use it without their prior written permission.  We cannot reproduce any distillery brand logo exactly or any copyrighted material, as this is copyright infringement. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding this copyright policy. \r\n\r\n3) You need to purchase the correct listing.  For barrels, we have &quot;Design Your Own&quot; barrel listings.  Simply select the &quot;My Photo or Logo&quot; option in the drop down menu.\r\n\r\nIMAGE FORMATS ACCEPTED:\r\nSince we are designers as well, we use and are very familiar with most major deisgn programs (Illustrator, Corel Draw, Photoshop, WPC, Flexi Sign, etc.)  We accept almost any image format, (jpg, png, eps, cdr, ai, psd, pdf or wpc).  Etsy does not allow uploading of any vector images, so if you have a vector image, please email it to art@customsentiments.com, being sure to reference your Etsy order number in the email.  \r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER CUSTOM DESIGN SERVICES? \r\nYes, we can design almost anything you can imagine!  There is an additional cost for custom designing or editing and the cost will be based on intricacy of the design and how long it will take to create.  Simply let us know what you are envisioning and we can give you a quote for your project.  Be as specific as possible in your request, (using visuals if possible) so that we can be sure your receive an accurate quote, timeline and to ensure you will be satisfied with the outcome.  Once you have placed your custom order, you will be referred to Joni, Kirsten or Leici to assist you in the design process.  You are allowed one small revision for your custom order.  Additional small revisions will be at additional cost, ($10 each).  If you decide to start completely over or your design goes into a different direction or you need a more involved edit, you will need to discuss the cost of the new design and you will be charged a new custom art fee for that new design.\r\n\r\nCAN YOU SEND ME A PHOTO OF MY ORDER: \r\nNo, Orders cannot be pulled from the production line to have photographs taken of your actual barrel prior to shipping it to you.  This is disruptive to the entire process and is not something we offer or will do.  Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪ BARREL FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪ \r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: What are the barrels made from?\r\nANSWER: Our barrels are made from premium quality American White Oak. The staves are air dried for two years and all barrels have a medium char.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I cure the barrel?\r\nANSWER: Barrels should be cured prior to use. Start by filling the barrel with boiling or hot water and leave it to soak for 3 to 5 days. This allows the barrel to swell tightly against the hoops and ensure that the barrel doesn&#39;t leak.  Your barrel WILL leak if you have not cured it.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Are glues or nails used to make the barrel?\r\nANSWER: No, our barrels are all hand crafted with no use of glues or nails.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How should the barrel be stored?\r\nANSWER: Barrels are best stored in a cool damp environment such as a wine cellar. This will keep the exterior from drying out and minimize evaporation (Angels Share).  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: How many times can I use my barrel?\r\nANSWER: These are high grade barrels!  With proper care, you can use your barrel for 8 to 10 years. Following the cleaning and re-charing instructions will insure a long life for your product and be sure to not let your barrel dry out.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: I left my barrel dry for an extented time. Now it leaks... what do I do?\r\nANSWER: In many cases just re-cure the barrel. If it continues leaking, submerge the barrel in water for a couple of days. After it&#39;s been submerged, dry the exterior with a towel and fill it with water to see if it continues to leak. If so, find the leak and apply barrel wax to the hole... If you can&#39;t stop the leaking... cut in half and use as a planter!\r\n\r\nQUESTION: My barrel is rough around the edges and does not look exactly like pictured.  Is this a defect?  \r\nANSWER: No, these are made with natural wood and therefore there will always be variation in color, roughness, veining, etc.  This does not affect the functionality of your barrel and is not a defect.  This is something that every barrel company has to deal with and cannot be helped regardless of where you order from.  We just like to be more upfront about it.  In the barrel world, the uniqueness of each barrel is also what we consider it&#39;s character.  Although similar, no two barrels will ever be alike and that is what gives the barrels their character and what lends to the beauty and uniqueness of each barrel.  We suggest loving your barrel for the truly unique piece of art and it will love you back ;)\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ CLEANING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How often do I clean my barrel?\r\nANSWER: When aging hard spirits such as whiskey, rum or tequila, clean the barrel after two or three batches (or every 1 to 2 years). For wine, cider, liquor or other low alcohol content spirits, clean after each batch.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I clean  my barrel?\r\nMULTI- STEP ANSWER:\r\n1.Dissolve the Cleaning Solution into warm water (we sell a cleaning kit for this). Fill the barrel with this cleaning solution and soak for 24 hours. Empty and rinse 3 times with hot water.\r\n2.Dissolve the Neutralizing Acid into warm water. Fill the barrel with this neutralizing solution and soak for 15 minutes. Empty and rinse the barrel 3 times with hot water.\r\n3.To re-char the barrel interior, drain the barrel for 3 hours. Place a butane torch in the bung and spigot hole and re-char the inside.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: To prevent the barrel from drying out and minimize the possibility of contamination, barrels should always be stored full with spirits or water with sterilizing solution.\r\n\r\n***See cleaning package directions for exact mixture quantities.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ STORING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I store my barrel?\r\nANSWER: When storing the barrel fill the barrel with a mixture of sterilizing tablets and cool water. Fill the barrel with the solution and leave in a cool damp place until you are ready to use again.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ AGING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How long do I age my spirits?\r\nANSWER: There&#39;s no formula for the perfect time to age your spirits. Age to taste! We suggest you taste your spirits every week and once aged to YOUR taste, start drinking or move it to a glass bottle to stop the aging process.  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do smaller barrels age the spirit faster than large barrels?\r\nANSWER: Yes... due to the greater surface or contact area ratio, small size barrels will age 5 to 10 times faster then your standard 55 gallon barrel. These means that one month in a small barrel will produce the equivalent aging to 1 to 1 1/2 years in a full size barrel.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ BOOTLEGGIN&#39; ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I get Whiskey from a bottle of Vodka, Swish or Moonshine?\r\nANSWER: When alcohol is distilled, either from potatoes, corn, fruit, grain or sugar cane, it produces Ethanol. A clear and tasteless alcohol. Distilleries then flavor and filter the alcohol to get their unique flavor. Vodka is the only alcohol you can buy in an unflavored form. When mixed with a bottle of  Barrel Premium Essence, you can recreate the taste of many of the famous brands.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Will a more expensive Vodka produce a better tasting whiskey?\r\nANSWER: No!  We actually recommend using a cheaper Vodka such as Taaka or the like, as it will pick up the flavors better and thus have a better taste.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do you sell Bootleg kits?  \r\nANSWER: Yes, we do!  Simply contact us and we would be happy to assist you.\r\n",

"title": "Damascus Steel and Wood Ring - Bourbon Barrel White Oak Stave Wood Ring Damascus Steel Ring",
"description": "This is a more traditional &quot;twisted&quot; pattern damascus steel.  This deeply etched and dramatically colored piece of folded steel is handmade, one-by-one for me by an artist in Denver, CO.  They are so labor intensive, that I will be limited to a total of 4 custom orders per month. Unfortunately, engraving is NOT possible with this ring.\n\nThe relative simplicity of bourbon barrel white oak really contrasts nicely with the complexity of damascus steel.  \n\nThe interior of the ring pictured happens to be from Knob Creek.  However, I have a few other barrel wood options  including Jack Daniels®, Jim Beam, Maker&#39;s Mark, Woodford Reserve, Buffalo Trace, Angel&#39;s Envy, and Old Rip Van Winkle. For this ring, I would also be willing to use the rare stock I have from The Macallan. Please see this blog post to see what I mean:\n\nhttp://www.wedgewoodrings.com/blog/2014/4/27/barrel-staves-and-the-many-options-at-our-disposal\n\nJACK DANIEL&#39;S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product!\n\n\nNote on width:\n\n6mm is the only width available for this ring. If you require a wider ring, there are very limited options\n\n7mm or 8mm.  However, it will be $40 per mm, and a custom listing will need to be made for you.\n\n\n+++SEE SHOP ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE SHOP PAGE FOR CURRENT SHIP DATE+++\n\n\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nDamascus lined wood rings can be adjusted up or down about 1/4 size (by removing or adding finish to the interior).  Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. REFUNDS AND EXCHANGES WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.  BE 100% SURE OF YOUR ACCURATE AND CORRECT SIZE BEFORE ORDERING.\n\nPlease click on the &quot;Policies&quot; link (under Shop Info) to see wood ring care instructions and FAQ.\n\nEach ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. This protective coating is sanded up to 12,000 grit for an unbelievable, glass-like finish.\n\nAll rings ship via USPS Priority (or Priority International) Small Flat Rate Box. If you are outside the US and Canada, your only shipping option is Global Express.  Please read below for details.  Insurance is mandatory for this ring, and included in the shipping charge. You pay what I pay for shipping, nothing more.\n\nFor customers outside the US:\n\nDue to changes in USPS policy, international packages sent to countries other than Canada can no longer be tracked past the US border.  Insurance claims are also not possible.  Due to this change and for your protection, international customers outside of Canada will be required to pay for USPS Global Express shipping ($44.95), which in addition to guaranteeing arrival within 3-5 business days (excepting intervention from your country’s customs department), also can be tracked and insured.  I wish I could offer a more economical solution, but cheaper options are too risky.\n\nInternational customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond the original delivery estimates. It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",

"sale_message": "Below are some very important policies that I hope will not be relevant to your order (because they are only relevant when something is wrong). PLEASE READ THEM in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING RETURNS: Every ring is made to order, to the exact size you provide to me.  Rings with a wood interior can be adjusted up or down by about 1/4 size, but beyond that YOUR RING CANNOT BE RESIZED.  Refunds and exchanges will not be possible, as an entirely new ring will have to be made for you.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING MODIFICATIONS: When I receive an order, even though the ship date seems far off (in practice, I often ship early), work begins on your ring immediately.  Within 48 hours, the metal for your ring has very likely already been ordered, and perhaps has already been completed. For this reason, if you need to make a change (size, width, etc.) AFTER 48 hours, there will be a charge of $30.  \r\n\r\nThank you for reading.  This is obviously an automatically generated message.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me through Etsy.  I respond fairly quickly.  If you find these policies overly draconian or otherwise problematic, please contact me as soon as possible so I can, with regret, cancel your order.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSteven Wyatt\r\nWedgeWood Rings",

Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information.

It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",
"policy_refunds": "You must provide me with an accurate size. The size you order will be the size you receive.  NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES WILL BE POSSIBLE IF YOU PROVIDE ME WITH THE WRONG SIZE.\r\n\r\nIf you order a ring with a wooden inner surface, and it turns out to be a little too big, I can decrease the size slightly.  If i is much too big, or if it is too small no refunds or exchanges will be offered, as a re-size is not possible, and it takes just as much material and time to provide a new ring.\r\n\r\nThe owner is responsible for maintaining the finish. This means scratches on the finish or loss of the glossy finish (issues that can be fixed and prevented with buffing wax) are not covered.  Rings are covered against breaks due to craftsmanship for 6 months - I will replace it for no charge.  If, however, your ring meets a bad end due to an accident (smashing in a door, or any other stresses that no wooden ring could expect to withstand), no refund will be offered. ",
"policy_additional": "**FAQ**\r\n\r\nWhy wooden rings?\r\n\r\n*Plain metal is boring.\r\n\r\n*Nickel allergies are quite common, and wooden rings are a great alternative. The titanium I use is also nickel-free and hypoallergenic.\r\n\r\n*They are beautiful, and no two are the same.\r\n\r\n*They make great gifts – especially for first wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is paper [close enough]) and 5th wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is WOOD)\r\n\r\nHow durable are your rings?\r\n\r\nThe most important factor that determines the durability of these rings is the owner. Each ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. As for the normal wear-and-tear from daily use, the perfect gloss will eventually become scratched (just as with metal rings), but buffing wax occasionally applied will protect the ring and its shine for years.\r\n\r\nThe titanium lined rings are unquestionably significantly stronger than rings made of wood alone. On the Moh’s Hardness Scale, Gold and Silver are around 3, Platinum 4.5, and Titanium is 6.  Any circumstances under which your Titanium is scratched, any precious metal would have been scratched all that more severely.  It is certainly not going to snap.\r\n\r\nPlease use common sense when wearing a ring with a wooden component.  WedgeWood Rings the strongest and most durable wood rings you can buy, but it is still a thin piece of wood you are wearing on your finger.  If you are going to move furniture, take it off first; if you are going to go climbing, do not wear your ring; if you are going to do some landscaping and are moving some rough stones, pocket the ring.\r\n\r\n“Hybrid Epoxy Finish”\r\n\r\nPart shameless marketing term, part description of a secret, painstakingly  brewed combination of epoxy and other finishes, this phrase describes the primary protection for the wood in your ring.  Think boat finish, thats pretty close to the meat of it.  The actual details I wouldnt tell my own mother (sorry mom!).\r\n\r\nSee this post for some more details: http://wedgewoodrings.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/the-promised-big-announcement/\r\n\r\nWhat size am I?\r\n\r\nTitanium ring sizes run from 4 to 16 including quarter sizes. I highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size. &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order. Keep a couple things in mind: your fingers are slightly swollen in the morning (don’t ask me why), your fingers are larger during warm weather, your fingers are larger after a meal (especially salty meals). This means that if you have your finger measured on a chilly evening before dinner, the result will be on the low end of your actual size.\r\n\r\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\r\n\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTitanium lined wood rings cannot be resized at all! Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. Refunds and exchanges will not be possible.\r\n\r\n~~~HOW DO I CARE FOR MY RING?~~~\r\n\r\nWater is no problem, sweat is no problem. Soap, occasional Purell, no problem!  If you work in a medical field, or any other profession that necessitates that your hands come in regular contact with strong solvents, I do NOT recommend you wear your ring while engaging in these activities.  No wood finish can withstand constant contact with solvents!  \r\n\r\nYour ring maintains its protection against water and soap only as long as the finish remains!  If you damage the finish, you must contact me for refinishing, or your ring may be permanently damaged.\r\n\r\nIn terms of maintaining the beauty of the finish, you can apply wax to the wood portions with a cloth. I personally use a suspension of hard and soft waxes in mineral oil (commercially available as butcher block conditioner) because the oil carries the waxes into any scratches that may be present and makes them invisible. It is also the first line of defense against anything harmful to the finish (including the friction with your finger). If you wanted to be extremely conscientious, you could apply it very often, like every few days or so. This sounds insane (and it is not really necessary), but it is literally the work of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWill my ring look just like the picture?\r\n\r\nEach ring is made to order and unique. The appearance will therefore vary according to the individual characteristics of the piece of wood. However, you can be assured that each ring is made to exacting standards of beauty and durability.\r\n\r\nCan I customize my ring?\r\n\r\nThe most common customization requests are width and profile modifications.\r\n\r\nWIDTH: I strive for “normal” proportions. I know that is unhelpful, so here is a rough guide: \r\n\r\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\r\n\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD EXTERIOR style is 4mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD INTERIOR style is 5mm. The maximum is 8mm.\r\n\r\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\r\n\r\nSize 5- 5mm\r\nSize 6 - 5.5mm\r\nSize 7- 6mm\r\nSize 8 - 6.5mm\r\nSize 9- 7mm\r\nSize 10 - 7.5mm\r\nSize 11+- 8mm\r\n\r\nPROFILE: By default, my rings have a lightly sloping dome shape– a traditional ring profile. Some people prefer a flat profile, and that is no problem. Just put your profile requests in the &quot;note to wedgewoodrings&quot; section at checkout.\r\n\r\nEngraving?\r\n\r\nI do not offer engraving for my rings. For the wood exterior rings you can get it engraved, however I do not recommend it. A jeweler can engrave titanium, but I do not know what clamping methods they might use. Because the vast majority of jewelers will be unfamiliar with wood and wood finish, they might damage it. Such damage would absolutely not be covered by warranty.\r\n\r\nWhere do you get your wood?\r\n\r\nExotic wood dealers on Ebay mainly. In some cases, I use found wood. I’ve even been known to raid roadside piles of cutoffs.\r\n\r\nCan you do custom orders using [insert wood/ wood combination here]?\r\n\r\nI certainly can if I have the wood. If I don’t have the wood, I may be able to get it. Send me an email with what you have in mind.\r\n\r\nSome examples of previous orders: ring made from the wood of an old house, ring made with sand from the honeymooners’ beach; ring made from a skateboard; ring made from a tree on the family farm.",

"description": "This is a great looking pen and the comfort grip makes it very comfortable to write with. This is a great fountain pen for novice users as well as those who are experts with the nib! \n\nThe wood is cypress (pre-prohibition cypress wood) and it was used for the fermenting process of bourbon before it got put into the barrels. The wood came from a distillery called Atherton Distillery in Kentucky, started in 1867. \n\nWhile making this pen, I found it amazing to sense the smell of bourbon, the barrels held for so many years. Because the cypress vats held bourbon that was 40% alcohol, I will be making 40 items with the wood that I have. This listing is 15/40.\n\nI make each pen in my garage workshop. I also use a finishing technique that involves the use of boiled linseed oil and 10 coats of acrylic, to give it a very durable and water resistant layer.\n\nThis pen comes with a refillable reservoir that can be used with your own ink well. It also comes with one black ink cartridge, easily found at most office supply stores. This pen also comes packaged in a gift box, ready for gifting. \n\nInternational orders may take up to 2 weeks to arrive.\n\nThank you for checking out my listing and elevate your routine!\n-Aye",

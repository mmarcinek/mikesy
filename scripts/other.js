"description": "&quot;I love the bag! I&#39;m looking forward to even more selection! Thank you for your speedy service!&quot; Shelly John \r\n\r\nPhotographers are some of the most creative artists around, so why then, do we carry the same bulky, black cases?! That is where I come in…my name is Lucienne and I was born and raised in Lima, Peru. Not too long ago I realized there was a need for stylish, easy-to-carry camera cases, so I began to design and make my own bags in Peru and I began calling my mini-company, Lu100 (the number 100 is pronounced cien in Spanish). \r\n\r\nLu100 fully padded, protective cases are perfect for a Single Lens Reflex Camera or a Digital Single Lens Reflex Camera. My cases, handcrafted in Lima, Peru using the finest Peruvian fabrics, are lightweight, comfortable and incredibly stylish. The outer layer of the cases is made of high quality cotton while the interior is layered and lined with either protective anti-pill fleece or nylon. All bags come with a sturdy, adjustable strap, small cushioned top handle and use a zipper closure. Additionally, all Lu100 bags have a convenient, large front pocket, as well as a smaller, hidden pocket inside the top flap to hold your additional accessories.\r\n\r\nTired of lugging around all of your bulky, expensive equipment? Lu100 bags are made by a photographer for photographers with convenience in mind. Made in Peru, Lu100 cases will not disappoint as they come in a myriad of colors and are perfect for the photographer who just wants to have his or her camera protected and easily accessible for spontaneous use!\r\n\r\nApproximate Dimensions:\r\nTop 7&quot; x 5&quot;\r\nHeight 8&quot;\r\nBottom 4&quot; x 4&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n* Uniquely designed and handcrafted in Lima, Peru.\r\n* Only finest Peruvian fabrics used, and depending on the Lu100 case, the fabric placement may vary to some degree.\r\n* Spot clean or dry clean. \r\n* 360 padded protection with sturdy zipper closure.\r\n* Two pockets: one large, outer pocket and one interior hidden pocket.\r\n* Adjustable shoulder strap and top handle for convenience.\r\n* Multiple fabric colors and textures, with Peruvian inspiration.\r\n\r\n** Please order in advance because bags are handmade and mailed from Lima, Peru. Please allow 2 to 3 weeks to receive orders.\r\n\r\n** Visit my shop to see other Lu100 styles: http://www.etsy.com/shop/LU100cases?ref=pr_shop_more",

"announcement": "***SHIPPING COSTS ARE FLEXIBLE. Please see our shop policies regarding shipping****\r\nMid Century design was all about style and functionality. Designers of the era created house hold items that were not only useful, but sculpturally beautiful. Just look at automobiles of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. Things were created then that are still held up as the standard of exquisite design. Here at Buddhagal we scour auctions and estate sales for the coolest in mid century items. We offer a variety of pieces including home decor, sporting goods, clothing and electronics. We watch for unusual items too; unexpected things that we don&#39;t see everywhere. Not confined to just Mid century items,  we do occasionally run across a truly remarkable antique. Check back often as Buddhagal tries to attend at least one estate sale every week.\r\nIf you are seeking something that you haven&#39;t been able to locate, let me know. I do get around a lot and visit different parts of Wisconsin to locate things. I will watch for specific items when requested. Please provide me with as much info and accurate descriptions as possible, including condition of a piece and price range. You will be under no obligation to purchase, and I may just learn something.",

"policy_welcome": "Welcome to BUDDHAGAL! At BUDDHAGAL we specialize in offering midcentury toys, sporting goods, household items and other small easy-to-ship items. We define &quot;midcentury&quot; as items dating mostly from 1940-1970. All of our items are described as accurately as possible, and anything we find in less than pristine condition will be covered in the description. We attend auctions and estate sales looking for great bargains, and hope to pass those low prices on to our buyers. Enjoy shopping and thanks for visiting!",
"policy_payment": "Here at BUDDHAGAL we accept Paypal and direct check out. It&#39;s the safest and easiest way to do business. If you must cancel your order please notify us immediately as items may have already shipped. Once an item is shipped the shipping cost cannot be refunded.\r\nPlease note that per Etsy policy items placed in your shopping cart are not ON HOLD, and unless you pay for it, anybody else can still purchase the item.. We will be happy to &quot;reserve&quot; an item for you per your request by simply changing the title of the item to &quot;Reserved For Buyer&quot;.\r\nMUSICAL INSTRUMENTS: All musical instruments are sold &quot;AS IS&quot; with the understanding that most vintage instruments may require repair or restoration to bring them to maximum playability. With that in mind, we do still accept returns on musical instruments if these repairs prove to be more than expected. We will refund the entire purchasing price. Shipping costs are not refundable. Please ask questions and ask for specific photos before purchasing. \r\n\r\nWE DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS FOR ITEMS DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING.",
"policy_shipping": "Shipping costs are estimated as if the item will be shipped to the East or West Coast, however shipping to the Midwest is much less. If we overestimate the cost of shipping by $1 or more we do refund the difference. The result is that nearly all of our buyers pay the actual cost of shipping and insurance with no hidden handling fees.\r\n\r\n Please allow us up to 3 days after purchase to ship your order. At BUDDHAGAL we usually use USPS Priority Mail to get the item to you quickly. USPS automatically insures items sent this way that are valued up to $100.  Larger items that are more costly to ship may be sent via Parcel Select  (formerly Parcel Post). You can request Parcel Select if you &#39;d prefer to spend less on shipping,  but it does take several days longer to arrive. Parcel Select items will also be insured.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING TO HAWAII: Items will be shipped insured via Parcel Select in most cases. Items may take as long as 4 weeks to arrive. Items shipped to Hawaii may require additional postage. Transactions can be easily canceled if the additional postage is cost prohibitive. Buyers can request Priority Mail shipping and pay the difference.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING TO ALASKA: Items to Alaska will be shipped insured via Parcel Select in most cases. Items shipped to Alaska may require additional postage. Transactions can be easily canceled if the additional postage is cost prohibitive. Buyers can request Priority Mail shipping and pay the difference. \r\n\r\nWE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITEMS LOST OR DAMAGED IN THE MAIL. \r\nWE DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS FOR ITEMS DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING.\r\n\r\nIn the event that USPS attempts to deliver an item, leaves notices, and is still unable to complete the delivery I can refund the sale price once the item comes back to me. The shipping price cannot be refunded. \r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AND SPECIAL OCCASIONS: We can never guarantee that an item will arrive in time for gift giving. We will do our best to get an item shipped same day or next day after purchase. \r\n\r\nTo further keep costs down I recycle used boxes. Wrapping items in lots of bubble wrap ensures a safe delivery, which sometimes causes me to use larger boxes. \r\n\r\nIf a potential buyer prefers, they can convo me their zip code and I will change the shipping cost to the actual cost of shipping before they purchase the item.\r\nI do not expect to be reimbursed if I under estimate shipping costs.\r\nWe do combine items for shipping and refund any overage of $1 or more  in the shipping payment.\r\n\r\nWe ship only to the United States. No international shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "Vintage items always show wear and age. Items are described to the best of our ability. We expect to miss a blemish occasionally in our descriptions, so please ask for more photos or specific info before purchasing if this is a concern.\r\nMost of these items are many decades old and are seldom pristine.\r\n\r\nWe do allow returns and refunds. Contact us within 3 days of receiving your item. The refund will be made after we receive the item back at BUDDHAGAL. Only the sale price will be refunded not the shipping. Buyer also pays return postage. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITEMS LOST OR DAMAGED IN THE MAIL. \r\n\r\nMUSICAL INSTRUMENTS: All musical instruments are sold &quot;AS IS&quot; with the understanding that most vintage instruments may require repair or restoration to bring them to maximum playability. This includes items that we have restored. With that in mind, we do still accept returns on musical instruments if these repairs prove to be more than expected. We will refund the entire purchasing price. Shipping costs are not refundable. Please ask questions and ask for specific photos before purchasing. \r\n\r\nELECTRONICS: Old radios, cameras, and clocks are quirky. They may work properly when we have them and be knocked about during shipping so that they don&#39;t work so well when they arrive. Often the repair may involve something as simple as reattaching a wire. With this in mind we do sell these items AS IS, but allow for returns and exchanges if they cannot be repaired.\r\n\r\nWE DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS FOR ITEMS DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING.\r\n Buyers may request additional insurance.",
"policy_additional": "USPS automatically insures items valued up to $100 when it is sent via Priority Mail. Items sent via Parcel Select will have insurance added. Insurance is for shipping only, should the item become lost or damaged during shipping.\r\n\r\nRESERVED or ON HOLD items: I  am happy to put an item ON HOLD or RESERVED for anyone wishing to arrange payment or determine actual shipping costs. I can do this for up to 3 days unless the potential buyer requests more time. If this HELD or RESERVED item is purchased by a third party in the meantime, I may have to cancel that transaction as a courtesy to the person for whom the item is being held.\r\n.",

"title": "Kodak Signet 35 Rangefinder Camera, 135 Film, Ektar Lens, 44mm, Vintage Photography Equipment & Decor, Upcycle, Repurpose",
"description": "This vintage Kodak Signet 35 Rangefinder camera from the 50&#39;s uses 135 film and includes a aluminum No. 22 lens adapter ring and screw on lens hood.  The body is a combination of what appears to be brushed aluminum, chrome steel, and black textured steel.\r\n\r\nThis is a great item for a photo or movie prop, as a film/photography decor item, upcycle or repurpose into a custom project or add to a vintage film & photography collection.  \r\n\r\nThe mechanical functions seem to work as designed, however as I am not a camera shop or repair person and it has not been fully tested with actual film, I cannot state that it is in working condition.  \r\n\r\nMeasurements:\r\n\r\nHeight:  3 1/4&quot;\r\nWidth:  4 5/8&quot;\r\nDepth:  2 1/2&quot;  (overall from lens face to camera back)\r\nBody Depth:  1 1/2&quot;\r\nLens Diameter:  1/2&quot;\r\nLens Body Diameter:  1 3/4&quot;\r\n\r\nGood overall physical condition.  The metal surface has wear, tarnish and rub marks from age and use.  The lenses and viewfinder have some visible dust accumulation.  \r\n\r\nThe shipping specified is calculated to go coast to coast. Please convo with your zip code for a more accurate shipping rate quote. The same applies to Canada and International shipping so please convo with your postal code for a rate quote.\r\n\r\nConvo with any questions and thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nPlease click the link below to see more vintage Photography & Film items:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MetalAndTweed?section_id=14472471&ref=shopsection_leftnav_2\r\n\r\nCheck out the rest of MetalandTweed by clicking the link below:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MetalAndTweed?ref=si_shop",

Each Dollbirdie item is carefully handcrafted with quality materials and with attention to details by myself, one at a time. My items are not mass produced. They are constructed one at a time with great care and inspection. I enjoy making items that are stylish enough to be fun and classic enough to be timelessly functional.

These policies are a product of considerable thought and merchandising experience and have been constructed for the mutual benefit of both Dollbirdies and her customers.

Any transaction cancellation by a customer must be received within 24 hours of placing the order.",
"policy_payment": "Pay Pal is my chosen method of payment. However, for those of you who do not have a Pay Pal account, you can use your credit card or an e-check with Pay Pal to purchase items without actually creating a Pay Pal account. Any transaction that does not have a confirmed payment within 72 hours of purchase will be re-listed for sale in the Dollbirdies shop. Any transaction completed on PayPal with a major credit card or an e-check will not ship until the pending funds are confirmed by PayPal.",
"policy_shipping": "Most domestic packages will ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. Once payment has been received, you order will be shipped promptly, usually within three to five days unless otherwise stated in the item&#39;s listing where it may be necessary to allow extra time for construction. Items that require a two week construction period will state this in the first line of the item&#39;s description.\r\n\r\nDollbirdies ships to Domestic, International and APO addresses.\r\n\r\nEven if you live in the same local area or in a near by area, Dollbirdies never allows merchandise to be picked up personally from the shop nor will Dollbirdies agree to meet with buyers to deliver merchandise. This policy is for the  safety of both Dollbirdies and the customer. It is to our mutual benefit to rely upon the carrier of Dollbirdies choice to handle the delivery of all packages with efficiency and cost effectiveness. \r\n\r\n Many ready to ship items can be shipped on the same day your Pay Pal amount has cleared, however in some cases, due to time constraints, the order will not ship until the following day. \r\n\r\nE-check payments or Major Credit Cards used to purchase merchandise through PayPal will not ship until notification has been made to Dollbirdies that the pending payment has cleared.  \r\n\r\nInternational packages weighing less than four pounds will ship First Class International Mail unless International Priority or International Express Priority rates are requested and paid for by the buyer. There are no tracking numbers available for purchase for International First Class mail.All  International packages require custom papers and the custom number can be made available for the buyer upon request. \r\n\r\nSome small items weighing less than 13 ounces may ship via USPS First Class Mail.  \r\n\r\nInsurance can be added to your purchase if you desire it by contacting Dollbirdies  when placing your order so the amount due can be adjusted to cover the cost. \r\n\r\nSome larger, heavier items, and some combined orders may ship via USPS Parcel Post with Delivery Confirmation due to weight and postal zone charges. \r\n\r\nAll domestic Dollbirdies merchandise is shipped with USPS Delivery Confirmation whether it is Priority Mail or First Class. An email notification will be sent to each customer when their package is shipped providing the Delivery Confirmation number.\r\n\r\n** International customers must be prepared to pay for and be aware of any customs or duty fees that may be required by their respective country. All said fees due are to be paid for by the buyer as they may apply for their respective countries. Dollbirdies has no knowledge of the customs or duty fees for international countries, nor does Dollbirdies have the ability to calculate and convert currency.  \r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country (&quot;Import Fees&quot;). The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such Import Fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.\r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the declared value (cost to the importer+shipping) that you put on the item is correct, as an incorrect declaration can get the importer fined or even prosecuted. I will not make a false declaration on a custom form.\r\n\r\n***No tracking numbers  are available for purchase for First Class International Mail, only Custom Numbers. Therefore there is no way for either Dollbirdies or the buyer to track their packages. Dollbirdies always appreciates being alerted when an international customer receives their merchandise. I am happy to provide customers with the custom number for any international package. Some countries provide limited tracking through custom numbers for customers to track through their local post office organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n****On a rare occasion, it is possible that a package may be lost, stolen or misdirected while in route. Please know that Dollbirdies will not be held responsible for any package once it has been placed in the possession of the USPS or another carrier. Once a package is placed in the hands of the carrier, Dollbirdies has no control over the delivery and Dollbirdies is not responsible to replace any merchandise lost due to the mishandling or loss of a package by the \r\ncarrier.",
"policy_refunds": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS OR EXCHANGES! \r\n\r\nThere are no refunds and merchandise may not be exchanged once it has been received. Returns are only accepted if a defect in materials used in construction has been found or an obvious problem in workmanship, such as an unfinished seam, etc, has been discovered. Merchandise is quality inspected before shipment.  If Dollbirdies has overlooked a problem with an item, please contact Dollbirdies about the issue and  follow  shop policy for returning the item. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies does not process refunds for those of you who may suffer from &quot;buyer&#39;s remorse&quot; so please consider your purchases seriously before making a transaction. In other words, &quot;all sales are final&quot; and merchandise can only be returned when there may be a problem  found in workmanship or a failure in hardware.\r\n\r\nThere are absolutely no refunds for any custom order, therefore no custom order may be returned or exchanged for any reason. Custom order transactions should be completed within three days of posting the listing. Dollbirdies is willing to allow a listing to remain in place for a longer period of time if the buyer convos to request more time. No materials that need to be ordered for a custom listing will be placed until the transaction has been completed by the buyer. Buyers should allow a two week construction period for custom orders after the materials necessary for the construction have arrived. Fabrics usually reach me between 5-7 days after placing a custom order. \r\n\r\n**Any item returned to Dollbirdies because of a defect in materials or workmanship  must be in an unused condition, with all labels and tags and must be returned within two weeks of receipt of the item. The item should be mailed in the same manner in which the item was shipped to you, unless, after contacting Dollbirdies you are instructed that you may send the item in a padded envelope, with the same carrier, and with delivery confirmation. International customers should follow the same procedure as domestic addresses only without tracking since it is not available for International First Class Mail. \r\n\r\n***Dollbirdies will not replace broken zippers. Dollbirdies is willing to repair or replace any rivet used on a strap handle that might fail due to normal use. Please contact Dollbirdies for the proper procedure to follow to request to have an item repaired and for the correct shipping address. The Buyer is responsible for  shipping an item for repair to Dollbirdies, while Dollbirdies will be responsible for  shipping the repaired item back to the customer.\r\n \r\n****Buyers are always responsible for shipping! Any shipping charges to return an item or replace an item will be paid for by the buyer and no shipping charges will be refunded for any purchase for any reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping for any item that may be returned to the shop regardless of the reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping charges should an item be returned and no item can be returned unless granted specific permission after contacting Dollbirdies. Dollbirdies is a final sale shop.\r\n",
"policy_additional": "Customers must be aware that most items must be constructed when their orders are placed. Please read the listings carefully. Items that require a two week construction period will read so in the beginning line of their listing. Due to variations in computer monitors colors of the merchandise photographed may vary as well. For this reason Dollbirdies always tries to include the color of  fabrics in the tags at the bottom of each individual listing. \r\n\r\nAll custom orders are not returnable or refundable and must be paid for in full before construction begins.Custom orders will be constructed in the order in which \r\nDollbirdies receives them. Customers need to allow two weeks for the construction of their custom orders after I receive the necessary materials that may have to be ordered.  Most special ordered fabrics reach me within 5-7 days after placing the order. If there should be a delay in construction the buyer will be notified by Dollbirdies immediately with an explanation as to why.\r\n\r\nAll transactions, including Custom Orders should be completed within three days of putting the item in your cart or within three days of posting the listing. If the transaction is not completed within three days, and if Dollbirdies has not been contacted by the customer, Dollbirdies reserves the right to place the merchandise back up for sale or to remove the custom listing from the shop without contacting the customer.\r\n\r\nAll items are handmade and you must allow for any variances that may slightly differ from the actual photos. You cannot make items by hand and find them to be identical! You cannot make multiple items from the same fabric and find them to be identical. Fabric placement is  considered when crafting each item. All dimensions may vary slightly as each item is individually made. When ordering multiple items of the same design and in the same fabrics you will find they will all differ in fabric placement. Almost all seams are double sewn for added strength and stability while handles are sewn repeatedly to ensure security. \r\n\r\n*The interior lining of some bags may differ from the stock photos of each bag in a specific print due to the fact that fabrics are often discontinued by their manufacturers and therefore unavailable for purchase. When this happens, Dollbirdies uses a companion print either from the same fabric group, or a coordinating print within the same color palate to use for the bag interior.\r\n\r\n** CHARITABLE REQUESTS:  Due to overwhelming weekly requests on the behalf of individuals, individual bloggers, groups and organizations, etc. Dollbirdies has chosen to no longer participate in donating free merchandise for fund raisers, give-a-ways, product reviews, advertising, auctions or charity donations. \r\n\r\nPlease do not make these types of requests any longer! This was an agonizing, well considered decision that Dollbirdies has been forced to make due to overwhelming requests for free merchandise. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies chooses to continue to participate in making charitable donations through other means to groups of my own choosing. \r\n\r\n***WHOLESALE: Dollbirdies does not wholesale but gives a small discount for large, bulk orders for those customers who are making purchases of favors for large parties or groups, etc.\r\n\r\n****NO MULTIPLE ORDER DISCOUNTS are available for those making several purchases of items of merchandise, whether they are all the same item or different items and  whether they are constructed from matching fabrics or different fabrics.  \r\n\r\n*****BRIDES!  For those Brides who are making a purchase of five or more items for their bridal party, Dollbirdies will combine appropriate shipping cost for the items and give a 10% discount on the total for the items purchased as long as the items are identical and constructed with the same fabrics. **There can be no discounts for Brides who choose to either combine items or who choose to purchase identical items but want the items to be constructed with multiple companion prints or coordinating prints.\r\n\r\n** I would like for my customers to please respect my policies and understand that I am not a part-time craft person. I do not run Dollbirdies for &quot;fun&quot; or to &quot;amuse&quot; myself in my spare time or for &quot;extra cash.&quot; I am a full time business woman who has chosen to work from home in order to support my family. I have been merchandising my hand crafted items for over thirty years through various venues. The quality of my merchandise is important to me as is my business reputation. Through Dollbirdies, I offer to the public, quality merchandise at a fair price. Dollbirdies is not open for business to haggle, to barter, or to exchange goods. Like everyone else, I work hard in order to pay my bills and support the people I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nCarefully note all laundry suggestions for Dollbirdies merchandise. It is impossible to launder some bags because of their hardware, even though the materials used in construction are machine washable. To extend the life of each Dollbirdie bag and to cut out unnecessary laundering, it is suggested upon receipt of the item to Scotch Guard it. If you find it necessary to launder your item Dollbirdies recommends spot cleaning or hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, air drying the item, and steam ironing any wrinkles. However, unless the fabric has been noted as &quot;dry clean only&quot;, a bag can be, if absolutely necessary, laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle with mild detergents and removed from the machine before the spin cycle. Gently squeeze out all the water that you possibly can and then allow machine laundered bags to drip and air dry as much as possible. (If you must machine dry your bag do so on the lowest heat setting on your machine to remove any remaining excess water and to reduce shrinkage.) Allowing items to air dry is best, followed by steam pressing. Wrinkles can be removed best by the use of a steam iron. Always remove any hard bottom from a bag before laundering. Do not launder any hard bottom. All batting used in construction of padded Dollbirdies bags, aside from insulbright used in insulated lunch totes, is 100% cotton and will shrink when laundered and dried in a machine.",

Each Dollbirdie item is carefully handcrafted with quality materials and with attention to details by myself, one at a time. My items are not mass produced. They are constructed one at a time with great care and inspection. I enjoy making items that are stylish enough to be fun and classic enough to be timelessly functional. Please come back and visit often! Please read Dollbirdies Policy section carefully for more information. These policies are a product of considerable thought and merchandising experience and have been constructed for the mutual benefit of both Dollbirdies and her customers. Dollbirdies is a final sales shop. Purchasing from Dollbirdies means you will abide by Dollbirdies shop policies. Any transaction cancellation by a customer must be received within 24 hours of placing the order.",
"policy_payment": "Pay Pal is my chosen method of payment. However, for those of you who do not have a Pay Pal account, you can use your credit card or an e-check with Pay Pal to purchase items without actually creating a Pay Pal account. Any transaction that does not have a confirmed payment within 72 hours of purchase will be re-listed for sale in the Dollbirdies shop. Any transaction completed on PayPal with a major credit card or an e-check will not ship until the pending funds are confirmed by PayPal.",
"policy_shipping": "Most domestic packages will ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. Once payment has been received, you order will be shipped promptly, usually within three to five days unless otherwise stated in the item&#39;s listing where it may be necessary to allow extra time for construction. Items that require a two week construction period will state this in the first line of the item&#39;s description.\r\n\r\nDollbirdies ships to Domestic, International and APO addresses.\r\n\r\nEven if you live in the same local area or in a near by area, Dollbirdies never allows merchandise to be picked up personally from the shop nor will Dollbirdies agree to meet with buyers to deliver merchandise. This policy is for the  safety of both Dollbirdies and the customer. It is to our mutual benefit to rely upon the carrier of Dollbirdies choice to handle the delivery of all packages with efficiency and cost effectiveness. \r\n\r\n Many ready to ship items can be shipped on the same day your Pay Pal amount has cleared, however in some cases, due to time constraints, the order will not ship until the following day. \r\n\r\nE-check payments or Major Credit Cards used to purchase merchandise through PayPal will not ship until notification has been made to Dollbirdies that the pending payment has cleared.  \r\n\r\nInternational packages weighing less than four pounds will ship First Class International Mail unless International Priority or International Express Priority rates are requested and paid for by the buyer. There are no tracking numbers available for purchase for International First Class mail.All  International packages require custom papers and the custom number can be made available for the buyer upon request. \r\n\r\nSome small items weighing less than 13 ounces may ship via USPS First Class Mail.  \r\n\r\nInsurance can be added to your purchase if you desire it by contacting Dollbirdies  when placing your order so the amount due can be adjusted to cover the cost. \r\n\r\nSome larger, heavier items, and some combined orders may ship via USPS Parcel Post with Delivery Confirmation due to weight and postal zone charges. \r\n\r\nAll domestic Dollbirdies merchandise is shipped with USPS Delivery Confirmation whether it is Priority Mail or First Class. An email notification will be sent to each customer when their package is shipped providing the Delivery Confirmation number.\r\n\r\n** International customers must be prepared to pay for and be aware of any customs or duty fees that may be required by their respective country. All said fees due are to be paid for by the buyer as they may apply for their respective countries. Dollbirdies has no knowledge of the customs or duty fees for international countries, nor does Dollbirdies have the ability to calculate and convert currency.  \r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country (&quot;Import Fees&quot;). The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such Import Fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.\r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the declared value (cost to the importer+shipping) that you put on the item is correct, as an incorrect declaration can get the importer fined or even prosecuted. I will not make a false declaration on a custom form.\r\n\r\n***No tracking numbers  are available for purchase for First Class International Mail, only Custom Numbers. Therefore there is no way for either Dollbirdies or the buyer to track their packages. Dollbirdies always appreciates being alerted when an international customer receives their merchandise. I am happy to provide customers with the custom number for any international package. Some countries provide limited tracking through custom numbers for customers to track through their local post office organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n****On a rare occasion, it is possible that a package may be lost, stolen or misdirected while in route. Please know that Dollbirdies will not be held responsible for any package once it has been placed in the possession of the USPS or another carrier. Once a package is placed in the hands of the carrier, Dollbirdies has no control over the delivery and Dollbirdies is not responsible to replace any merchandise lost due to the mishandling or loss of a package by the \r\ncarrier.",
"policy_refunds": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS OR EXCHANGES! \r\n\r\nThere are no refunds and merchandise may not be exchanged once it has been received. Returns are only accepted if a defect in materials used in construction has been found or an obvious problem in workmanship, such as an unfinished seam, etc, has been discovered. Merchandise is quality inspected before shipment.  If Dollbirdies has overlooked a problem with an item, please contact Dollbirdies about the issue and  follow  shop policy for returning the item. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies does not process refunds for those of you who may suffer from &quot;buyer&#39;s remorse&quot; so please consider your purchases seriously before making a transaction. In other words, &quot;all sales are final&quot; and merchandise can only be returned when there may be a problem  found in workmanship or a failure in hardware.\r\n\r\nThere are absolutely no refunds for any custom order, therefore no custom order may be returned or exchanged for any reason. Custom order transactions should be completed within three days of posting the listing. Dollbirdies is willing to allow a listing to remain in place for a longer period of time if the buyer convos to request more time. No materials that need to be ordered for a custom listing will be placed until the transaction has been completed by the buyer. Buyers should allow a two week construction period for custom orders after the materials necessary for the construction have arrived. Fabrics usually reach me between 5-7 days after placing a custom order. \r\n\r\n**Any item returned to Dollbirdies because of a defect in materials or workmanship  must be in an unused condition, with all labels and tags and must be returned within two weeks of receipt of the item. The item should be mailed in the same manner in which the item was shipped to you, unless, after contacting Dollbirdies you are instructed that you may send the item in a padded envelope, with the same carrier, and with delivery confirmation. International customers should follow the same procedure as domestic addresses only without tracking since it is not available for International First Class Mail. \r\n\r\n***Dollbirdies will not replace broken zippers. Dollbirdies is willing to repair or replace any rivet used on a strap handle that might fail due to normal use. Please contact Dollbirdies for the proper procedure to follow to request to have an item repaired and for the correct shipping address. The Buyer is responsible for  shipping an item for repair to Dollbirdies, while Dollbirdies will be responsible for  shipping the repaired item back to the customer.\r\n \r\n****Buyers are always responsible for shipping! Any shipping charges to return an item or replace an item will be paid for by the buyer and no shipping charges will be refunded for any purchase for any reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping for any item that may be returned to the shop regardless of the reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping charges should an item be returned and no item can be returned unless granted specific permission after contacting Dollbirdies. Dollbirdies is a final sale shop.\r\n",
"policy_additional": "Customers must be aware that most items must be constructed when their orders are placed. Please read the listings carefully. Items that require a two week construction period will read so in the beginning line of their listing. Due to variations in computer monitors colors of the merchandise photographed may vary as well. For this reason Dollbirdies always tries to include the color of  fabrics in the tags at the bottom of each individual listing. \r\n\r\nAll custom orders are not returnable or refundable and must be paid for in full before construction begins.Custom orders will be constructed in the order in which \r\nDollbirdies receives them. Customers need to allow two weeks for the construction of their custom orders after I receive the necessary materials that may have to be ordered.  Most special ordered fabrics reach me within 5-7 days after placing the order. If there should be a delay in construction the buyer will be notified by Dollbirdies immediately with an explanation as to why.\r\n\r\nAll transactions, including Custom Orders should be completed within three days of putting the item in your cart or within three days of posting the listing. If the transaction is not completed within three days, and if Dollbirdies has not been contacted by the customer, Dollbirdies reserves the right to place the merchandise back up for sale or to remove the custom listing from the shop without contacting the customer.\r\n\r\nAll items are handmade and you must allow for any variances that may slightly differ from the actual photos. You cannot make items by hand and find them to be identical! You cannot make multiple items from the same fabric and find them to be identical. Fabric placement is  considered when crafting each item. All dimensions may vary slightly as each item is individually made. When ordering multiple items of the same design and in the same fabrics you will find they will all differ in fabric placement. Almost all seams are double sewn for added strength and stability while handles are sewn repeatedly to ensure security. \r\n\r\n*The interior lining of some bags may differ from the stock photos of each bag in a specific print due to the fact that fabrics are often discontinued by their manufacturers and therefore unavailable for purchase. When this happens, Dollbirdies uses a companion print either from the same fabric group, or a coordinating print within the same color palate to use for the bag interior.\r\n\r\n** CHARITABLE REQUESTS:  Due to overwhelming weekly requests on the behalf of individuals, individual bloggers, groups and organizations, etc. Dollbirdies has chosen to no longer participate in donating free merchandise for fund raisers, give-a-ways, product reviews, advertising, auctions or charity donations. \r\n\r\nPlease do not make these types of requests any longer! This was an agonizing, well considered decision that Dollbirdies has been forced to make due to overwhelming requests for free merchandise. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies chooses to continue to participate in making charitable donations through other means to groups of my own choosing. \r\n\r\n***WHOLESALE: Dollbirdies does not wholesale but gives a small discount for large, bulk orders for those customers who are making purchases of favors for large parties or groups, etc.\r\n\r\n****NO MULTIPLE ORDER DISCOUNTS are available for those making several purchases of items of merchandise, whether they are all the same item or different items and  whether they are constructed from matching fabrics or different fabrics.  \r\n\r\n*****BRIDES!  For those Brides who are making a purchase of five or more items for their bridal party, Dollbirdies will combine appropriate shipping cost for the items and give a 10% discount on the total for the items purchased as long as the items are identical and constructed with the same fabrics. **There can be no discounts for Brides who choose to either combine items or who choose to purchase identical items but want the items to be constructed with multiple companion prints or coordinating prints.\r\n\r\n** I would like for my customers to please respect my policies and understand that I am not a part-time craft person. I do not run Dollbirdies for &quot;fun&quot; or to &quot;amuse&quot; myself in my spare time or for &quot;extra cash.&quot; I am a full time business woman who has chosen to work from home in order to support my family. I have been merchandising my hand crafted items for over thirty years through various venues. The quality of my merchandise is important to me as is my business reputation. Through Dollbirdies, I offer to the public, quality merchandise at a fair price. Dollbirdies is not open for business to haggle, to barter, or to exchange goods. Like everyone else, I work hard in order to pay my bills and support the people I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nCarefully note all laundry suggestions for Dollbirdies merchandise. It is impossible to launder some bags because of their hardware, even though the materials used in construction are machine washable. To extend the life of each Dollbirdie bag and to cut out unnecessary laundering, it is suggested upon receipt of the item to Scotch Guard it. If you find it necessary to launder your item Dollbirdies recommends spot cleaning or hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, air drying the item, and steam ironing any wrinkles. However, unless the fabric has been noted as &quot;dry clean only&quot;, a bag can be, if absolutely necessary, laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle with mild detergents and removed from the machine before the spin cycle. Gently squeeze out all the water that you possibly can and then allow machine laundered bags to drip and air dry as much as possible. (If you must machine dry your bag do so on the lowest heat setting on your machine to remove any remaining excess water and to reduce shrinkage.) Allowing items to air dry is best, followed by steam pressing. Wrinkles can be removed best by the use of a steam iron. Always remove any hard bottom from a bag before laundering. Do not launder any hard bottom. All batting used in construction of padded Dollbirdies bags, aside from insulbright used in insulated lunch totes, is 100% cotton and will shrink when laundered and dried in a machine.",

"policy_additional": "Owen&#39;s Originals\r\nValue, Service, Integrity.\r\n\r\nOwen&#39;s Originals was founded in 1978 by Brad Owen. Brad was an art teacher in the public schools for many years and began the company by hand painting backdrops for photographers. At that time nearly all backdrops sold in the USA were still being produced here in the United States. Brad was always proud of the product he put out, treated his customers fairly and tried to offer a quality product at a fair price. Over the years, things have changed-not only in the backdrop market but in nearly every market in this country. Cheap imported products from Taiwan, India, Korea and now China have driven prices down on many goods and put a lot of American companies out of business. Here at Owen&#39;s Originals, we are not afraid to tell it the way it is. Even though many of our competitors would lead you to believe that the products they sell are made in this country, the truth is that most are not. Although, we did not want to import foreign products, several years ago it became apparent that if we were going to stay in business, it would be a necessity to do so. The main reason for this was cost. Our competition began lowering their prices as more and more inexpensive products became available. Soon, the selling price for musiln backdrops fell below what it cost us to buy the raw material and produce them here. Also, as American textile mills were forced to close, it became impossible to buy American made muslin. So, now, although you can still buy an American painted muslin from us, it will be painted on Indian material. As we are now forced to sell imported goods, it has become our mission to find and sell the best quality merchandise and to offer the best customer service. Although Vu-Pro is an imported line of products, we stand behind these items with American pride in our reputation as an honest company to deal with. That reputation has been earned over the past three decades",

Winter 1978- spine cracked both sides, binding glue delicate…still bound. edges of some pages a bit ripply. Has ripply-ness along spine like with other 78 issue but more subtle. \nWinter 1977- spine cracked in front, rip to lower spine- not as delicate as winter 78 issue- more solidly bound, has a medium rip on first page.\n\nIssues Spring 77 and 78 are ripply along spine, effects most pages, hard to completely open in middle, when flattened pages buckle a bit. (see pics for details) Should not effect read or view ability overall. The other two issues are ripply but a lot more subtly….easier to turn pages as well. \n\nThe covers all have regular vintage wear to varying degrees….but none that are in bad condition…. has a lot of light discoloration, some staining, scuffing, creases, smudges, little rips and wear about the edges. \nPages have regular vintage wear from an avid yet gentle reader.\nAn antique tint to the pages. \n\nTake a peek at my other 50s to 70s retro photography magazines:\nFirst up on the list is another lot of 35mm magazines from the late 60s to early 70s...\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/219466354/35mm-photography-ziff-davis-60s-70s\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/219443781/photography-annual-ziff-davis-1950s\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/218686162/lot-of-7-color-photography-magazines\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/218396363/popular-photographys-woman-ziff-davis\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/218399721/us-camera-annual-72-photojournalism\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/218549580/invitation-to-photography-fully\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/218550051/modern-photography-annual-illustrated\n\nand also look for more on the way!\n\nwe combine shipping- just ask!\n\n$25.00\n\nshipping: 13.00",

So please don&#39;t be upset if it&#39;s late a day or 2 I am just giving it extra love. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that as of Nov1st there is a a minimum of 2 week lead time due to high volume of sales through etsy and local new yorkers. If this is an urgent order or you have a deadline to meet please let me know immediately.  You also have the option to pay for over night shipping.  If you are an out of USA order contact me if you want insurance or expedited shipping.  Thank you again for buying hand made and hand stitched by a human not a machine. Have a great day and I deeply and sincerely appreciate your order and hope that if you love it you will give me feedback on etsy as it&#39;s really important to me and my work.  And if you are unhappy for any reason you contact me directly and I will try my hardest to resolve it. Thank u  again. \r\n\r\nI love leather. I love how it smells, how it feels in my hand, how the thread goes through the needle, and how the needle punctures the leather.  My work relationship with leather started accidentally  when someone sold me a box of leather remnants in a flea market in 1998 for 20 dollars.  I brought it home and made miniature purses and boots out of  it,  sewing and gluing them onto cards.  From the cards I went on to make leather journals and from there, the satchels, the bags, and the belts. The elation it brought me made me quit my job as a school director and pursue &quot;leather&quot; full time.  \r\nInfatuation with leather did not start there. My first real leather belt came from and NYU craft show, where the leather smith made me a custom belt. The rhythmic pounding of his hammer on his wooden table created music through the leaves and the trees. The breeze... shook me, the power of creation had echoed in me.\r\nI wore the belt almost every day, hearing the echo,  for 10 years.  Of the few things that made it back home after two and half years were my first real leather shoes, which I wore in the heat of summer and the dead of winter. The more I walked in them the better they felt.  The belt and shoes are long gone, they were stolen out of my car in a parking garage in N.Y.C., but the feeling of good strong quality leather, as something that grows with you, stays with me. \r\nThis and other memories came to me as I cut my first bag, sewed my first pieces, without any schooling or training in leather, just hearing the echo. Creating a multidimensional functional piece with pockets, closures, hidden compartments, secret places out of something flat and languid makes me smile, and gives me a high every single time. Leather is my calling. \r\n\r\nDEAR INTERNATINAL BUYERS\r\nOn January 27th the shipping to International countried greatly increased almost 10 dollars for every flat rate package. Please bare with me and I adjust my prices accordingly on the site.

I am eager to work with you.\r\n\r\nIf an item arrives damaged or in an unsatisfactory condition (a rare occurrence, but it could happen), I am happy to work with you. But do follow these guidelines.\r\n\r\n1. Please let me know within 14 days.\r\n\r\n2. For the bulk of my inventory ($8 or less), just describe the issue, and I will usually be able to offer a refund or replacement, whichever works best for you.\r\n\r\n3.

However, for those of you who do not have a Pay Pal account, you can use your credit card or an e-check with Pay Pal to purchase items without actually creating a Pay Pal account.

Any transaction completed on PayPal with a major credit card or an e-check will not ship until the pending funds are confirmed by PayPal.",
"policy_shipping": "Most domestic packages will ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. Once payment has been received, you order will be shipped promptly, usually within three to five days unless otherwise stated in the item&#39;s listing where it may be necessary to allow extra time for construction. Items that require a two week construction period will state this in the first line of the item&#39;s description.\r\n\r\nDollbirdies ships to Domestic, International and APO addresses.\r\n\r\nEven if you live in the same local area or in a near by area, Dollbirdies never allows merchandise to be picked up personally from the shop nor will Dollbirdies agree to meet with buyers to deliver merchandise. This policy is for the  safety of both Dollbirdies and the customer. It is to our mutual benefit to rely upon the carrier of Dollbirdies choice to handle the delivery of all packages with efficiency and cost effectiveness. \r\n\r\n Many ready to ship items can be shipped on the same day your Pay Pal amount has cleared, however in some cases, due to time constraints, the order will not ship until the following day. \r\n\r\nE-check payments or Major Credit Cards used to purchase merchandise through PayPal will not ship until notification has been made to Dollbirdies that the pending payment has cleared.  \r\n\r\nInternational packages weighing less than four pounds will ship First Class International Mail unless International Priority or International Express Priority rates are requested and paid for by the buyer. There are no tracking numbers available for purchase for International First Class mail.All  International packages require custom papers and the custom number can be made available for the buyer upon request. \r\n\r\nSome small items weighing less than 13 ounces may ship via USPS First Class Mail.  \r\n\r\nInsurance can be added to your purchase if you desire it by contacting Dollbirdies  when placing your order so the amount due can be adjusted to cover the cost. \r\n\r\nSome larger, heavier items, and some combined orders may ship via USPS Parcel Post with Delivery Confirmation due to weight and postal zone charges. \r\n\r\nAll domestic Dollbirdies merchandise is shipped with USPS Delivery Confirmation whether it is Priority Mail or First Class. An email notification will be sent to each customer when their package is shipped providing the Delivery Confirmation number.\r\n\r\n** International customers must be prepared to pay for and be aware of any customs or duty fees that may be required by their respective country. All said fees due are to be paid for by the buyer as they may apply for their respective countries. Dollbirdies has no knowledge of the customs or duty fees for international countries, nor does Dollbirdies have the ability to calculate and convert currency.  \r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country (&quot;Import Fees&quot;). The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such Import Fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.\r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the declared value (cost to the importer+shipping) that you put on the item is correct, as an incorrect declaration can get the importer fined or even prosecuted. I will not make a false declaration on a custom form.\r\n\r\n***No tracking numbers  are available for purchase for First Class International Mail, only Custom Numbers. Therefore there is no way for either Dollbirdies or the buyer to track their packages. Dollbirdies always appreciates being alerted when an international customer receives their merchandise. I am happy to provide customers with the custom number for any international package. Some countries provide limited tracking through custom numbers for customers to track through their local post office organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n****On a rare occasion, it is possible that a package may be lost, stolen or misdirected while in route. Please know that Dollbirdies will not be held responsible for any package once it has been placed in the possession of the USPS or another carrier.

Merchandise is quality inspected before shipment.

In other words, &quot;all sales are final&quot; and merchandise can only be returned when there may be a problem  found in workmanship or a failure in hardware.\r\n\r\nThere are absolutely no refunds for any custom order, therefore no custom order may be returned or exchanged for any reason. Custom order transactions should be completed within three days of posting the listing. Dollbirdies is willing to allow a listing to remain in place for a longer period of time if the buyer convos to request more time. No materials that need to be ordered for a custom listing will be placed until the transaction has been completed by the buyer. Buyers should allow a two week construction period for custom orders after the materials necessary for the construction have arrived. Fabrics usually reach me between 5-7 days after placing a custom order. \r\n\r\n**Any item returned to Dollbirdies because of a defect in materials or workmanship  must be in an unused condition, with all labels and tags and must be returned within two weeks of receipt of the item. The item should be mailed in the same manner in which the item was shipped to you, unless, after contacting Dollbirdies you are instructed that you may send the item in a padded envelope, with the same carrier, and with delivery confirmation. International customers should follow the same procedure as domestic addresses only without tracking since it is not available for International First Class Mail. \r\n\r\n***Dollbirdies will not replace broken zippers. Dollbirdies is willing to repair or replace any rivet used on a strap handle that might fail due to normal use.

"policy_additional": "Customers must be aware that most items must be constructed when their orders are placed. Please read the listings carefully. Items that require a two week construction period will read so in the beginning line of their listing. Due to variations in computer monitors colors of the merchandise photographed may vary as well. For this reason Dollbirdies always tries to include the color of  fabrics in the tags at the bottom of each individual listing. \r\n\r\nAll custom orders are not returnable or refundable and must be paid for in full before construction begins.Custom orders will be constructed in the order in which \r\nDollbirdies receives them. Customers need to allow two weeks for the construction of their custom orders after I receive the necessary materials that may have to be ordered.  Most special ordered fabrics reach me within 5-7 days after placing the order. If there should be a delay in construction the buyer will be notified by Dollbirdies immediately with an explanation as to why.\r\n\r\nAll transactions, including Custom Orders should be completed within three days of putting the item in your cart or within three days of posting the listing. If the transaction is not completed within three days, and if Dollbirdies has not been contacted by the customer, Dollbirdies reserves the right to place the merchandise back up for sale or to remove the custom listing from the shop without contacting the customer.\r\n\r\nAll items are handmade and you must allow for any variances that may slightly differ from the actual photos. You cannot make items by hand and find them to be identical! You cannot make multiple items from the same fabric and find them to be identical. Fabric placement is  considered when crafting each item. All dimensions may vary slightly as each item is individually made. When ordering multiple items of the same design and in the same fabrics you will find they will all differ in fabric placement. Almost all seams are double sewn for added strength and stability while handles are sewn repeatedly to ensure security. \r\n\r\n*The interior lining of some bags may differ from the stock photos of each bag in a specific print due to the fact that fabrics are often discontinued by their manufacturers and therefore unavailable for purchase. When this happens, Dollbirdies uses a companion print either from the same fabric group, or a coordinating print within the same color palate to use for the bag interior.\r\n\r\n** CHARITABLE REQUESTS:  Due to overwhelming weekly requests on the behalf of individuals, individual bloggers, groups and organizations, etc. Dollbirdies has chosen to no longer participate in donating free merchandise for fund raisers, give-a-ways, product reviews, advertising, auctions or charity donations. \r\n\r\nPlease do not make these types of requests any longer! This was an agonizing, well considered decision that Dollbirdies has been forced to make due to overwhelming requests for free merchandise. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies chooses to continue to participate in making charitable donations through other means to groups of my own choosing. \r\n\r\n***WHOLESALE: Dollbirdies does not wholesale but gives a small discount for large, bulk orders for those customers who are making purchases of favors for large parties or groups, etc.\r\n\r\n****NO MULTIPLE ORDER DISCOUNTS are available for those making several purchases of items of merchandise, whether they are all the same item or different items and  whether they are constructed from matching fabrics or different fabrics.  \r\n\r\n*****BRIDES!  For those Brides who are making a purchase of five or more items for their bridal party, Dollbirdies will combine appropriate shipping cost for the items and give a 10% discount on the total for the items purchased as long as the items are identical and constructed with the same fabrics. **There can be no discounts for Brides who choose to either combine items or who choose to purchase identical items but want the items to be constructed with multiple companion prints or coordinating prints.\r\n\r\n** I would like for my customers to please respect my policies and understand that I am not a part-time craft person. I do not run Dollbirdies for &quot;fun&quot; or to &quot;amuse&quot; myself in my spare time or for &quot;extra cash.&quot; I am a full time business woman who has chosen to work from home in order to support my family. I have been merchandising my hand crafted items for over thirty years through various venues. The quality of my merchandise is important to me as is my business reputation. Through Dollbirdies, I offer to the public, quality merchandise at a fair price. Dollbirdies is not open for business to haggle, to barter, or to exchange goods. Like everyone else, I work hard in order to pay my bills and support the people I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nCarefully note all laundry suggestions for Dollbirdies merchandise. It is impossible to launder some bags because of their hardware, even though the materials used in construction are machine washable. To extend the life of each Dollbirdie bag and to cut out unnecessary laundering, it is suggested upon receipt of the item to Scotch Guard it. If you find it necessary to launder your item Dollbirdies recommends spot cleaning or hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, air drying the item, and steam ironing any wrinkles. However, unless the fabric has been noted as &quot;dry clean only&quot;, a bag can be, if absolutely necessary, laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle with mild detergents and removed from the machine before the spin cycle. Gently squeeze out all the water that you possibly can and then allow machine laundered bags to drip and air dry as much as possible. (If you must machine dry your bag do so on the lowest heat setting on your machine to remove any remaining excess water and to reduce shrinkage.) Allowing items to air dry is best, followed by steam pressing. Wrinkles can be removed best by the use of a steam iron. Always remove any hard bottom from a bag before laundering. Do not launder any hard bottom. All batting used in construction of padded Dollbirdies bags, aside from insulbright used in insulated lunch totes, is 100% cotton and will shrink when laundered and dried in a machine.",

Once payment has been received, you order will be shipped promptly, usually within three to five days unless otherwise stated in the item&#39;s listing where it may be necessary to allow extra time for construction. Items that require a two week construction period will state this in the first line of the item&#39;s description.\r\n\r\nDollbirdies ships to Domestic, International and APO addresses.\r\n\r\nEven if you live in the same local area or in a near by area, Dollbirdies never allows merchandise to be picked up personally from the shop nor will Dollbirdies agree to meet with buyers to deliver merchandise. This policy is for the  safety of both Dollbirdies and the customer. It is to our mutual benefit to rely upon the carrier of Dollbirdies choice to handle the delivery of all packages with efficiency and cost effectiveness. \r\n\r\n Many ready to ship items can be shipped on the same day your Pay Pal amount has cleared, however in some cases, due to time constraints, the order will not ship until the following day. \r\n\r\nE-check payments or Major Credit Cards used to purchase merchandise through PayPal will not ship until notification has been made to Dollbirdies that the pending payment has cleared.  \r\n\r\nInternational packages weighing less than four pounds will ship First Class International Mail unless International Priority or International Express Priority rates are requested and paid for by the buyer. There are no tracking numbers available for purchase for International First Class mail.All  International packages require custom papers and the custom number can be made available for the buyer upon request. \r\n\r\nSome small items weighing less than 13 ounces may ship via USPS First Class Mail.  \r\n\r\nInsurance can be added to your purchase if you desire it by contacting Dollbirdies  when placing your order so the amount due can be adjusted to cover the cost. \r\n\r\nSome larger, heavier items, and some combined orders may ship via USPS Parcel Post with Delivery Confirmation due to weight and postal zone charges. \r\n\r\nAll domestic Dollbirdies merchandise is shipped with USPS Delivery Confirmation whether it is Priority Mail or First Class. An email notification will be sent to each customer when their package is shipped providing the Delivery Confirmation number.\r\n\r\n** International customers must be prepared to pay for and be aware of any customs or duty fees that may be required by their respective country. All said fees due are to be paid for by the buyer as they may apply for their respective countries. Dollbirdies has no knowledge of the customs or duty fees for international countries, nor does Dollbirdies have the ability to calculate and convert currency.  \r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country (&quot;Import Fees&quot;). The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such Import Fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.\r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the declared value (cost to the importer+shipping) that you put on the item is correct, as an incorrect declaration can get the importer fined or even prosecuted. I will not make a false declaration on a custom form.\r\n\r\n***No tracking numbers  are available for purchase for First Class International Mail, only Custom Numbers.

This was an agonizing, well considered decision that Dollbirdies has been forced to make due to overwhelming requests for free merchandise. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies chooses to continue to participate in making charitable donations through other means to groups of my own choosing. \r\n\r\n***WHOLESALE: Dollbirdies does not wholesale but gives a small discount for large, bulk orders for those customers who are making purchases of favors for large parties or groups, etc.\r\n\r\n****NO MULTIPLE ORDER DISCOUNTS are available for those making several purchases of items of merchandise, whether they are all the same item or different items and  whether they are constructed from matching fabrics or different fabrics.  \r\n\r\n*****BRIDES!  For those Brides who are making a purchase of five or more items for their bridal party, Dollbirdies will combine appropriate shipping cost for the items and give a 10% discount on the total for the items purchased as long as the items are identical and constructed with the same fabrics. **There can be no discounts for Brides who choose to either combine items or who choose to purchase identical items but want the items to be constructed with multiple companion prints or coordinating prints.\r\n\r\n** I would like for my customers to please respect my policies and understand that I am not a part-time craft person. I do not run Dollbirdies for &quot;fun&quot; or to &quot;amuse&quot; myself in my spare time or for &quot;extra cash.&quot; I am a full time business woman who has chosen to work from home in order to support my family. I have been merchandising my hand crafted items for over thirty years through various venues. The quality of my merchandise is important to me as is my business reputation. Through Dollbirdies, I offer to the public, quality merchandise at a fair price. Dollbirdies is not open for business to haggle, to barter, or to exchange goods. Like everyone else, I work hard in order to pay my bills and support the people I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nCarefully note all laundry suggestions for Dollbirdies merchandise. It is impossible to launder some bags because of their hardware, even though the materials used in construction are machine washable. To extend the life of each Dollbirdie bag and to cut out unnecessary laundering, it is suggested upon receipt of the item to Scotch Guard it. If you find it necessary to launder your item Dollbirdies recommends spot cleaning or hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, air drying the item, and steam ironing any wrinkles. However, unless the fabric has been noted as &quot;dry clean only&quot;, a bag can be, if absolutely necessary, laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle with mild detergents and removed from the machine before the spin cycle. Gently squeeze out all the water that you possibly can and then allow machine laundered bags to drip and air dry as much as possible. (If you must machine dry your bag do so on the lowest heat setting on your machine to remove any remaining excess water and to reduce shrinkage.) Allowing items to air dry is best, followed by steam pressing. Wrinkles can be removed best by the use of a steam iron. Always remove any hard bottom from a bag before laundering. Do not launder any hard bottom. All batting used in construction of padded Dollbirdies bags, aside from insulbright used in insulated lunch totes, is 100% cotton and will shrink when laundered and dried in a machine.",

"policy_payment": "Pay Pal is my chosen method of payment. However, for those of you who do not have a Pay Pal account, you can use your credit card or an e-check with Pay Pal to purchase items without actually creating a Pay Pal account. Any transaction that does not have a confirmed payment within 72 hours of purchase will be re-listed for sale in the Dollbirdies shop. Any transaction completed on PayPal with a major credit card or an e-check will not ship until the pending funds are confirmed by PayPal.",
"policy_shipping": "Most domestic packages will ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. Once payment has been received, you order will be shipped promptly, usually within three to five days unless otherwise stated in the item&#39;s listing where it may be necessary to allow extra time for construction. Items that require a two week construction period will state this in the first line of the item&#39;s description.\r\n\r\nDollbirdies ships to Domestic, International and APO addresses.\r\n\r\nEven if you live in the same local area or in a near by area, Dollbirdies never allows merchandise to be picked up personally from the shop nor will Dollbirdies agree to meet with buyers to deliver merchandise. This policy is for the  safety of both Dollbirdies and the customer. It is to our mutual benefit to rely upon the carrier of Dollbirdies choice to handle the delivery of all packages with efficiency and cost effectiveness. \r\n\r\n Many ready to ship items can be shipped on the same day your Pay Pal amount has cleared, however in some cases, due to time constraints, the order will not ship until the following day. \r\n\r\nE-check payments or Major Credit Cards used to purchase merchandise through PayPal will not ship until notification has been made to Dollbirdies that the pending payment has cleared.  \r\n\r\nInternational packages weighing less than four pounds will ship First Class International Mail unless International Priority or International Express Priority rates are requested and paid for by the buyer. There are no tracking numbers available for purchase for International First Class mail.All  International packages require custom papers and the custom number can be made available for the buyer upon request. \r\n\r\nSome small items weighing less than 13 ounces may ship via USPS First Class Mail.  \r\n\r\nInsurance can be added to your purchase if you desire it by contacting Dollbirdies  when placing your order so the amount due can be adjusted to cover the cost. \r\n\r\nSome larger, heavier items, and some combined orders may ship via USPS Parcel Post with Delivery Confirmation due to weight and postal zone charges. \r\n\r\nAll domestic Dollbirdies merchandise is shipped with USPS Delivery Confirmation whether it is Priority Mail or First Class. An email notification will be sent to each customer when their package is shipped providing the Delivery Confirmation number.\r\n\r\n** International customers must be prepared to pay for and be aware of any customs or duty fees that may be required by their respective country. All said fees due are to be paid for by the buyer as they may apply for their respective countries. Dollbirdies has no knowledge of the customs or duty fees for international countries, nor does Dollbirdies have the ability to calculate and convert currency.  \r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country (&quot;Import Fees&quot;). The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such Import Fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.\r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the declared value (cost to the importer+shipping) that you put on the item is correct, as an incorrect declaration can get the importer fined or even prosecuted. I will not make a false declaration on a custom form.\r\n\r\n***No tracking numbers  are available for purchase for First Class International Mail, only Custom Numbers. Therefore there is no way for either Dollbirdies or the buyer to track their packages. Dollbirdies always appreciates being alerted when an international customer receives their merchandise. I am happy to provide customers with the custom number for any international package. Some countries provide limited tracking through custom numbers for customers to track through their local post office organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n****On a rare occasion, it is possible that a package may be lost, stolen or misdirected while in route. Please know that Dollbirdies will not be held responsible for any package once it has been placed in the possession of the USPS or another carrier. Once a package is placed in the hands of the carrier, Dollbirdies has no control over the delivery and Dollbirdies is not responsible to replace any merchandise lost due to the mishandling or loss of a package by the \r\ncarrier.",
"policy_refunds": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS OR EXCHANGES! \r\n\r\nThere are no refunds and merchandise may not be exchanged once it has been received. Returns are only accepted if a defect in materials used in construction has been found or an obvious problem in workmanship, such as an unfinished seam, etc, has been discovered. Merchandise is quality inspected before shipment.  If Dollbirdies has overlooked a problem with an item, please contact Dollbirdies about the issue and  follow  shop policy for returning the item. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies does not process refunds for those of you who may suffer from &quot;buyer&#39;s remorse&quot; so please consider your purchases seriously before making a transaction. In other words, &quot;all sales are final&quot; and merchandise can only be returned when there may be a problem  found in workmanship or a failure in hardware.\r\n\r\nThere are absolutely no refunds for any custom order, therefore no custom order may be returned or exchanged for any reason. Custom order transactions should be completed within three days of posting the listing. Dollbirdies is willing to allow a listing to remain in place for a longer period of time if the buyer convos to request more time. No materials that need to be ordered for a custom listing will be placed until the transaction has been completed by the buyer. Buyers should allow a two week construction period for custom orders after the materials necessary for the construction have arrived. Fabrics usually reach me between 5-7 days after placing a custom order. \r\n\r\n**Any item returned to Dollbirdies because of a defect in materials or workmanship  must be in an unused condition, with all labels and tags and must be returned within two weeks of receipt of the item. The item should be mailed in the same manner in which the item was shipped to you, unless, after contacting Dollbirdies you are instructed that you may send the item in a padded envelope, with the same carrier, and with delivery confirmation. International customers should follow the same procedure as domestic addresses only without tracking since it is not available for International First Class Mail. \r\n\r\n***Dollbirdies will not replace broken zippers. Dollbirdies is willing to repair or replace any rivet used on a strap handle that might fail due to normal use. Please contact Dollbirdies for the proper procedure to follow to request to have an item repaired and for the correct shipping address. The Buyer is responsible for  shipping an item for repair to Dollbirdies, while Dollbirdies will be responsible for  shipping the repaired item back to the customer.\r\n \r\n****Buyers are always responsible for shipping! Any shipping charges to return an item or replace an item will be paid for by the buyer and no shipping charges will be refunded for any purchase for any reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping for any item that may be returned to the shop regardless of the reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping charges should an item be returned and no item can be returned unless granted specific permission after contacting Dollbirdies. Dollbirdies is a final sale shop.\r\n",
"policy_additional": "Customers must be aware that most items must be constructed when their orders are placed. Please read the listings carefully. Items that require a two week construction period will read so in the beginning line of their listing. Due to variations in computer monitors colors of the merchandise photographed may vary as well. For this reason Dollbirdies always tries to include the color of  fabrics in the tags at the bottom of each individual listing. \r\n\r\nAll custom orders are not returnable or refundable and must be paid for in full before construction begins.Custom orders will be constructed in the order in which \r\nDollbirdies receives them. Customers need to allow two weeks for the construction of their custom orders after I receive the necessary materials that may have to be ordered.  Most special ordered fabrics reach me within 5-7 days after placing the order. If there should be a delay in construction the buyer will be notified by Dollbirdies immediately with an explanation as to why.\r\n\r\nAll transactions, including Custom Orders should be completed within three days of putting the item in your cart or within three days of posting the listing. If the transaction is not completed within three days, and if Dollbirdies has not been contacted by the customer, Dollbirdies reserves the right to place the merchandise back up for sale or to remove the custom listing from the shop without contacting the customer.\r\n\r\nAll items are handmade and you must allow for any variances that may slightly differ from the actual photos. You cannot make items by hand and find them to be identical! You cannot make multiple items from the same fabric and find them to be identical. Fabric placement is  considered when crafting each item. All dimensions may vary slightly as each item is individually made. When ordering multiple items of the same design and in the same fabrics you will find they will all differ in fabric placement. Almost all seams are double sewn for added strength and stability while handles are sewn repeatedly to ensure security. \r\n\r\n*The interior lining of some bags may differ from the stock photos of each bag in a specific print due to the fact that fabrics are often discontinued by their manufacturers and therefore unavailable for purchase. When this happens, Dollbirdies uses a companion print either from the same fabric group, or a coordinating print within the same color palate to use for the bag interior.\r\n\r\n** CHARITABLE REQUESTS:  Due to overwhelming weekly requests on the behalf of individuals, individual bloggers, groups and organizations, etc. Dollbirdies has chosen to no longer participate in donating free merchandise for fund raisers, give-a-ways, product reviews, advertising, auctions or charity donations. \r\n\r\nPlease do not make these types of requests any longer! This was an agonizing, well considered decision that Dollbirdies has been forced to make due to overwhelming requests for free merchandise. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies chooses to continue to participate in making charitable donations through other means to groups of my own choosing. \r\n\r\n***WHOLESALE: Dollbirdies does not wholesale but gives a small discount for large, bulk orders for those customers who are making purchases of favors for large parties or groups, etc.\r\n\r\n****NO MULTIPLE ORDER DISCOUNTS are available for those making several purchases of items of merchandise, whether they are all the same item or different items and  whether they are constructed from matching fabrics or different fabrics.  \r\n\r\n*****BRIDES!  For those Brides who are making a purchase of five or more items for their bridal party, Dollbirdies will combine appropriate shipping cost for the items and give a 10% discount on the total for the items purchased as long as the items are identical and constructed with the same fabrics. **There can be no discounts for Brides who choose to either combine items or who choose to purchase identical items but want the items to be constructed with multiple companion prints or coordinating prints.\r\n\r\n** I would like for my customers to please respect my policies and understand that I am not a part-time craft person. I do not run Dollbirdies for &quot;fun&quot; or to &quot;amuse&quot; myself in my spare time or for &quot;extra cash.&quot; I am a full time business woman who has chosen to work from home in order to support my family. I have been merchandising my hand crafted items for over thirty years through various venues. The quality of my merchandise is important to me as is my business reputation. Through Dollbirdies, I offer to the public, quality merchandise at a fair price. Dollbirdies is not open for business to haggle, to barter, or to exchange goods. Like everyone else, I work hard in order to pay my bills and support the people I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nCarefully note all laundry suggestions for Dollbirdies merchandise. It is impossible to launder some bags because of their hardware, even though the materials used in construction are machine washable. To extend the life of each Dollbirdie bag and to cut out unnecessary laundering, it is suggested upon receipt of the item to Scotch Guard it. If you find it necessary to launder your item Dollbirdies recommends spot cleaning or hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, air drying the item, and steam ironing any wrinkles. However, unless the fabric has been noted as &quot;dry clean only&quot;, a bag can be, if absolutely necessary, laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle with mild detergents and removed from the machine before the spin cycle. Gently squeeze out all the water that you possibly can and then allow machine laundered bags to drip and air dry as much as possible. (If you must machine dry your bag do so on the lowest heat setting on your machine to remove any remaining excess water and to reduce shrinkage.) Allowing items to air dry is best, followed by steam pressing. Wrinkles can be removed best by the use of a steam iron. Always remove any hard bottom from a bag before laundering. Do not launder any hard bottom. All batting used in construction of padded Dollbirdies bags, aside from insulbright used in insulated lunch totes, is 100% cotton and will shrink when laundered and dried in a machine.",

Each Dollbirdie item is carefully handcrafted with quality materials and with attention to details by myself, one at a time. My items are not mass produced. They are constructed one at a time with great care and inspection. I enjoy making items that are stylish enough to be fun and classic enough to be timelessly functional. Please come back and visit often! Please read Dollbirdies Policy section carefully for more information. These policies are a product of considerable thought and merchandising experience and have been constructed for the mutual benefit of both Dollbirdies and her customers.

Any transaction cancellation by a customer must be received within 24 hours of placing the order.",
"policy_payment": "Pay Pal is my chosen method of payment. However, for those of you who do not have a Pay Pal account, you can use your credit card or an e-check with Pay Pal to purchase items without actually creating a Pay Pal account. Any transaction that does not have a confirmed payment within 72 hours of purchase will be re-listed for sale in the Dollbirdies shop. Any transaction completed on PayPal with a major credit card or an e-check will not ship until the pending funds are confirmed by PayPal.",
"policy_shipping": "Most domestic packages will ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. Once payment has been received, you order will be shipped promptly, usually within three to five days unless otherwise stated in the item&#39;s listing where it may be necessary to allow extra time for construction. Items that require a two week construction period will state this in the first line of the item&#39;s description.\r\n\r\nDollbirdies ships to Domestic, International and APO addresses.\r\n\r\nEven if you live in the same local area or in a near by area, Dollbirdies never allows merchandise to be picked up personally from the shop nor will Dollbirdies agree to meet with buyers to deliver merchandise. This policy is for the  safety of both Dollbirdies and the customer. It is to our mutual benefit to rely upon the carrier of Dollbirdies choice to handle the delivery of all packages with efficiency and cost effectiveness. \r\n\r\n Many ready to ship items can be shipped on the same day your Pay Pal amount has cleared, however in some cases, due to time constraints, the order will not ship until the following day. \r\n\r\nE-check payments or Major Credit Cards used to purchase merchandise through PayPal will not ship until notification has been made to Dollbirdies that the pending payment has cleared.  \r\n\r\nInternational packages weighing less than four pounds will ship First Class International Mail unless International Priority or International Express Priority rates are requested and paid for by the buyer. There are no tracking numbers available for purchase for International First Class mail.All  International packages require custom papers and the custom number can be made available for the buyer upon request. \r\n\r\nSome small items weighing less than 13 ounces may ship via USPS First Class Mail.  \r\n\r\nInsurance can be added to your purchase if you desire it by contacting Dollbirdies  when placing your order so the amount due can be adjusted to cover the cost. \r\n\r\nSome larger, heavier items, and some combined orders may ship via USPS Parcel Post with Delivery Confirmation due to weight and postal zone charges. \r\n\r\nAll domestic Dollbirdies merchandise is shipped with USPS Delivery Confirmation whether it is Priority Mail or First Class. An email notification will be sent to each customer when their package is shipped providing the Delivery Confirmation number.\r\n\r\n** International customers must be prepared to pay for and be aware of any customs or duty fees that may be required by their respective country. All said fees due are to be paid for by the buyer as they may apply for their respective countries. Dollbirdies has no knowledge of the customs or duty fees for international countries, nor does Dollbirdies have the ability to calculate and convert currency.  \r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country (&quot;Import Fees&quot;). The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such Import Fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.\r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the declared value (cost to the importer+shipping) that you put on the item is correct, as an incorrect declaration can get the importer fined or even prosecuted. I will not make a false declaration on a custom form.\r\n\r\n***No tracking numbers  are available for purchase for First Class International Mail, only Custom Numbers. Therefore there is no way for either Dollbirdies or the buyer to track their packages. Dollbirdies always appreciates being alerted when an international customer receives their merchandise. I am happy to provide customers with the custom number for any international package. Some countries provide limited tracking through custom numbers for customers to track through their local post office organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n****On a rare occasion, it is possible that a package may be lost, stolen or misdirected while in route. Please know that Dollbirdies will not be held responsible for any package once it has been placed in the possession of the USPS or another carrier. Once a package is placed in the hands of the carrier, Dollbirdies has no control over the delivery and Dollbirdies is not responsible to replace any merchandise lost due to the mishandling or loss of a package by the \r\ncarrier.",
"policy_refunds": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS OR EXCHANGES! \r\n\r\nThere are no refunds and merchandise may not be exchanged once it has been received. Returns are only accepted if a defect in materials used in construction has been found or an obvious problem in workmanship, such as an unfinished seam, etc, has been discovered. Merchandise is quality inspected before shipment.  If Dollbirdies has overlooked a problem with an item, please contact Dollbirdies about the issue and  follow  shop policy for returning the item. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies does not process refunds for those of you who may suffer from &quot;buyer&#39;s remorse&quot; so please consider your purchases seriously before making a transaction. In other words, &quot;all sales are final&quot; and merchandise can only be returned when there may be a problem  found in workmanship or a failure in hardware.\r\n\r\nThere are absolutely no refunds for any custom order, therefore no custom order may be returned or exchanged for any reason. Custom order transactions should be completed within three days of posting the listing. Dollbirdies is willing to allow a listing to remain in place for a longer period of time if the buyer convos to request more time. No materials that need to be ordered for a custom listing will be placed until the transaction has been completed by the buyer. Buyers should allow a two week construction period for custom orders after the materials necessary for the construction have arrived. Fabrics usually reach me between 5-7 days after placing a custom order. \r\n\r\n**Any item returned to Dollbirdies because of a defect in materials or workmanship  must be in an unused condition, with all labels and tags and must be returned within two weeks of receipt of the item. The item should be mailed in the same manner in which the item was shipped to you, unless, after contacting Dollbirdies you are instructed that you may send the item in a padded envelope, with the same carrier, and with delivery confirmation. International customers should follow the same procedure as domestic addresses only without tracking since it is not available for International First Class Mail. \r\n\r\n***Dollbirdies will not replace broken zippers. Dollbirdies is willing to repair or replace any rivet used on a strap handle that might fail due to normal use. Please contact Dollbirdies for the proper procedure to follow to request to have an item repaired and for the correct shipping address. The Buyer is responsible for  shipping an item for repair to Dollbirdies, while Dollbirdies will be responsible for  shipping the repaired item back to the customer.\r\n \r\n****Buyers are always responsible for shipping! Any shipping charges to return an item or replace an item will be paid for by the buyer and no shipping charges will be refunded for any purchase for any reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping for any item that may be returned to the shop regardless of the reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping charges should an item be returned and no item can be returned unless granted specific permission after contacting Dollbirdies. Dollbirdies is a final sale shop.\r\n",
"policy_additional": "Customers must be aware that most items must be constructed when their orders are placed. Please read the listings carefully. Items that require a two week construction period will read so in the beginning line of their listing. Due to variations in computer monitors colors of the merchandise photographed may vary as well. For this reason Dollbirdies always tries to include the color of  fabrics in the tags at the bottom of each individual listing. \r\n\r\nAll custom orders are not returnable or refundable and must be paid for in full before construction begins.Custom orders will be constructed in the order in which \r\nDollbirdies receives them. Customers need to allow two weeks for the construction of their custom orders after I receive the necessary materials that may have to be ordered.  Most special ordered fabrics reach me within 5-7 days after placing the order. If there should be a delay in construction the buyer will be notified by Dollbirdies immediately with an explanation as to why.\r\n\r\nAll transactions, including Custom Orders should be completed within three days of putting the item in your cart or within three days of posting the listing. If the transaction is not completed within three days, and if Dollbirdies has not been contacted by the customer, Dollbirdies reserves the right to place the merchandise back up for sale or to remove the custom listing from the shop without contacting the customer.\r\n\r\nAll items are handmade and you must allow for any variances that may slightly differ from the actual photos. You cannot make items by hand and find them to be identical! You cannot make multiple items from the same fabric and find them to be identical. Fabric placement is  considered when crafting each item. All dimensions may vary slightly as each item is individually made. When ordering multiple items of the same design and in the same fabrics you will find they will all differ in fabric placement. Almost all seams are double sewn for added strength and stability while handles are sewn repeatedly to ensure security. \r\n\r\n*The interior lining of some bags may differ from the stock photos of each bag in a specific print due to the fact that fabrics are often discontinued by their manufacturers and therefore unavailable for purchase. When this happens, Dollbirdies uses a companion print either from the same fabric group, or a coordinating print within the same color palate to use for the bag interior.\r\n\r\n** CHARITABLE REQUESTS:  Due to overwhelming weekly requests on the behalf of individuals, individual bloggers, groups and organizations, etc. Dollbirdies has chosen to no longer participate in donating free merchandise for fund raisers, give-a-ways, product reviews, advertising, auctions or charity donations. \r\n\r\nPlease do not make these types of requests any longer! This was an agonizing, well considered decision that Dollbirdies has been forced to make due to overwhelming requests for free merchandise. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies chooses to continue to participate in making charitable donations through other means to groups of my own choosing. \r\n\r\n***WHOLESALE: Dollbirdies does not wholesale but gives a small discount for large, bulk orders for those customers who are making purchases of favors for large parties or groups, etc.\r\n\r\n****NO MULTIPLE ORDER DISCOUNTS are available for those making several purchases of items of merchandise, whether they are all the same item or different items and  whether they are constructed from matching fabrics or different fabrics.  \r\n\r\n*****BRIDES!  For those Brides who are making a purchase of five or more items for their bridal party, Dollbirdies will combine appropriate shipping cost for the items and give a 10% discount on the total for the items purchased as long as the items are identical and constructed with the same fabrics. **There can be no discounts for Brides who choose to either combine items or who choose to purchase identical items but want the items to be constructed with multiple companion prints or coordinating prints.\r\n\r\n** I would like for my customers to please respect my policies and understand that I am not a part-time craft person. I do not run Dollbirdies for &quot;fun&quot; or to &quot;amuse&quot; myself in my spare time or for &quot;extra cash.&quot; I am a full time business woman who has chosen to work from home in order to support my family. I have been merchandising my hand crafted items for over thirty years through various venues. The quality of my merchandise is important to me as is my business reputation. Through Dollbirdies, I offer to the public, quality merchandise at a fair price. Dollbirdies is not open for business to haggle, to barter, or to exchange goods. Like everyone else, I work hard in order to pay my bills and support the people I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nCarefully note all laundry suggestions for Dollbirdies merchandise. It is impossible to launder some bags because of their hardware, even though the materials used in construction are machine washable. To extend the life of each Dollbirdie bag and to cut out unnecessary laundering, it is suggested upon receipt of the item to Scotch Guard it. If you find it necessary to launder your item Dollbirdies recommends spot cleaning or hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, air drying the item, and steam ironing any wrinkles. However, unless the fabric has been noted as &quot;dry clean only&quot;, a bag can be, if absolutely necessary, laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle with mild detergents and removed from the machine before the spin cycle. Gently squeeze out all the water that you possibly can and then allow machine laundered bags to drip and air dry as much as possible. (If you must machine dry your bag do so on the lowest heat setting on your machine to remove any remaining excess water and to reduce shrinkage.) Allowing items to air dry is best, followed by steam pressing. Wrinkles can be removed best by the use of a steam iron. Always remove any hard bottom from a bag before laundering. Do not launder any hard bottom. All batting used in construction of padded Dollbirdies bags, aside from insulbright used in insulated lunch totes, is 100% cotton and will shrink when laundered and dried in a machine.",

Each Dollbirdie item is carefully handcrafted with quality materials and with attention to details by myself, one at a time. My items are not mass produced. They are constructed one at a time with great care and inspection. I enjoy making items that are stylish enough to be fun and classic enough to be timelessly functional. Please come back and visit often! Please read Dollbirdies Policy section carefully for more information. These policies are a product of considerable thought and merchandising experience and have been constructed for the mutual benefit of both Dollbirdies and her customers. Dollbirdies is a final sales shop. Purchasing from Dollbirdies means you will abide by Dollbirdies shop policies. Any transaction cancellation by a customer must be received within 24 hours of placing the order.",
"policy_payment": "Pay Pal is my chosen method of payment. However, for those of you who do not have a Pay Pal account, you can use your credit card or an e-check with Pay Pal to purchase items without actually creating a Pay Pal account. Any transaction that does not have a confirmed payment within 72 hours of purchase will be re-listed for sale in the Dollbirdies shop. Any transaction completed on PayPal with a major credit card or an e-check will not ship until the pending funds are confirmed by PayPal.",
"policy_shipping": "Most domestic packages will ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. Once payment has been received, you order will be shipped promptly, usually within three to five days unless otherwise stated in the item&#39;s listing where it may be necessary to allow extra time for construction. Items that require a two week construction period will state this in the first line of the item&#39;s description.\r\n\r\nDollbirdies ships to Domestic, International and APO addresses.\r\n\r\nEven if you live in the same local area or in a near by area, Dollbirdies never allows merchandise to be picked up personally from the shop nor will Dollbirdies agree to meet with buyers to deliver merchandise. This policy is for the  safety of both Dollbirdies and the customer. It is to our mutual benefit to rely upon the carrier of Dollbirdies choice to handle the delivery of all packages with efficiency and cost effectiveness. \r\n\r\n Many ready to ship items can be shipped on the same day your Pay Pal amount has cleared, however in some cases, due to time constraints, the order will not ship until the following day. \r\n\r\nE-check payments or Major Credit Cards used to purchase merchandise through PayPal will not ship until notification has been made to Dollbirdies that the pending payment has cleared.  \r\n\r\nInternational packages weighing less than four pounds will ship First Class International Mail unless International Priority or International Express Priority rates are requested and paid for by the buyer. There are no tracking numbers available for purchase for International First Class mail.All  International packages require custom papers and the custom number can be made available for the buyer upon request. \r\n\r\nSome small items weighing less than 13 ounces may ship via USPS First Class Mail.  \r\n\r\nInsurance can be added to your purchase if you desire it by contacting Dollbirdies  when placing your order so the amount due can be adjusted to cover the cost. \r\n\r\nSome larger, heavier items, and some combined orders may ship via USPS Parcel Post with Delivery Confirmation due to weight and postal zone charges. \r\n\r\nAll domestic Dollbirdies merchandise is shipped with USPS Delivery Confirmation whether it is Priority Mail or First Class. An email notification will be sent to each customer when their package is shipped providing the Delivery Confirmation number.\r\n\r\n** International customers must be prepared to pay for and be aware of any customs or duty fees that may be required by their respective country. All said fees due are to be paid for by the buyer as they may apply for their respective countries. Dollbirdies has no knowledge of the customs or duty fees for international countries, nor does Dollbirdies have the ability to calculate and convert currency.  \r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country (&quot;Import Fees&quot;). The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such Import Fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.\r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the declared value (cost to the importer+shipping) that you put on the item is correct, as an incorrect declaration can get the importer fined or even prosecuted. I will not make a false declaration on a custom form.\r\n\r\n***No tracking numbers  are available for purchase for First Class International Mail, only Custom Numbers. Therefore there is no way for either Dollbirdies or the buyer to track their packages. Dollbirdies always appreciates being alerted when an international customer receives their merchandise. I am happy to provide customers with the custom number for any international package. Some countries provide limited tracking through custom numbers for customers to track through their local post office organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n****On a rare occasion, it is possible that a package may be lost, stolen or misdirected while in route. Please know that Dollbirdies will not be held responsible for any package once it has been placed in the possession of the USPS or another carrier. Once a package is placed in the hands of the carrier, Dollbirdies has no control over the delivery and Dollbirdies is not responsible to replace any merchandise lost due to the mishandling or loss of a package by the \r\ncarrier.",
"policy_refunds": "ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS OR EXCHANGES! \r\n\r\nThere are no refunds and merchandise may not be exchanged once it has been received. Returns are only accepted if a defect in materials used in construction has been found or an obvious problem in workmanship, such as an unfinished seam, etc, has been discovered. Merchandise is quality inspected before shipment.  If Dollbirdies has overlooked a problem with an item, please contact Dollbirdies about the issue and  follow  shop policy for returning the item. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies does not process refunds for those of you who may suffer from &quot;buyer&#39;s remorse&quot; so please consider your purchases seriously before making a transaction. In other words, &quot;all sales are final&quot; and merchandise can only be returned when there may be a problem  found in workmanship or a failure in hardware.\r\n\r\nThere are absolutely no refunds for any custom order, therefore no custom order may be returned or exchanged for any reason. Custom order transactions should be completed within three days of posting the listing. Dollbirdies is willing to allow a listing to remain in place for a longer period of time if the buyer convos to request more time. No materials that need to be ordered for a custom listing will be placed until the transaction has been completed by the buyer. Buyers should allow a two week construction period for custom orders after the materials necessary for the construction have arrived. Fabrics usually reach me between 5-7 days after placing a custom order. \r\n\r\n**Any item returned to Dollbirdies because of a defect in materials or workmanship  must be in an unused condition, with all labels and tags and must be returned within two weeks of receipt of the item. The item should be mailed in the same manner in which the item was shipped to you, unless, after contacting Dollbirdies you are instructed that you may send the item in a padded envelope, with the same carrier, and with delivery confirmation. International customers should follow the same procedure as domestic addresses only without tracking since it is not available for International First Class Mail. \r\n\r\n***Dollbirdies will not replace broken zippers. Dollbirdies is willing to repair or replace any rivet used on a strap handle that might fail due to normal use. Please contact Dollbirdies for the proper procedure to follow to request to have an item repaired and for the correct shipping address. The Buyer is responsible for  shipping an item for repair to Dollbirdies, while Dollbirdies will be responsible for  shipping the repaired item back to the customer.\r\n \r\n****Buyers are always responsible for shipping! Any shipping charges to return an item or replace an item will be paid for by the buyer and no shipping charges will be refunded for any purchase for any reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping for any item that may be returned to the shop regardless of the reason. Dollbirdies will not refund shipping charges should an item be returned and no item can be returned unless granted specific permission after contacting Dollbirdies. Dollbirdies is a final sale shop.\r\n",
"policy_additional": "Customers must be aware that most items must be constructed when their orders are placed. Please read the listings carefully. Items that require a two week construction period will read so in the beginning line of their listing. Due to variations in computer monitors colors of the merchandise photographed may vary as well. For this reason Dollbirdies always tries to include the color of  fabrics in the tags at the bottom of each individual listing. \r\n\r\nAll custom orders are not returnable or refundable and must be paid for in full before construction begins.Custom orders will be constructed in the order in which \r\nDollbirdies receives them. Customers need to allow two weeks for the construction of their custom orders after I receive the necessary materials that may have to be ordered.  Most special ordered fabrics reach me within 5-7 days after placing the order. If there should be a delay in construction the buyer will be notified by Dollbirdies immediately with an explanation as to why.\r\n\r\nAll transactions, including Custom Orders should be completed within three days of putting the item in your cart or within three days of posting the listing. If the transaction is not completed within three days, and if Dollbirdies has not been contacted by the customer, Dollbirdies reserves the right to place the merchandise back up for sale or to remove the custom listing from the shop without contacting the customer.\r\n\r\nAll items are handmade and you must allow for any variances that may slightly differ from the actual photos. You cannot make items by hand and find them to be identical! You cannot make multiple items from the same fabric and find them to be identical. Fabric placement is  considered when crafting each item. All dimensions may vary slightly as each item is individually made. When ordering multiple items of the same design and in the same fabrics you will find they will all differ in fabric placement. Almost all seams are double sewn for added strength and stability while handles are sewn repeatedly to ensure security. \r\n\r\n*The interior lining of some bags may differ from the stock photos of each bag in a specific print due to the fact that fabrics are often discontinued by their manufacturers and therefore unavailable for purchase. When this happens, Dollbirdies uses a companion print either from the same fabric group, or a coordinating print within the same color palate to use for the bag interior.\r\n\r\n** CHARITABLE REQUESTS:  Due to overwhelming weekly requests on the behalf of individuals, individual bloggers, groups and organizations, etc. Dollbirdies has chosen to no longer participate in donating free merchandise for fund raisers, give-a-ways, product reviews, advertising, auctions or charity donations. \r\n\r\nPlease do not make these types of requests any longer! This was an agonizing, well considered decision that Dollbirdies has been forced to make due to overwhelming requests for free merchandise. \r\n\r\nDollbirdies chooses to continue to participate in making charitable donations through other means to groups of my own choosing. \r\n\r\n***WHOLESALE: Dollbirdies does not wholesale but gives a small discount for large, bulk orders for those customers who are making purchases of favors for large parties or groups, etc.\r\n\r\n****NO MULTIPLE ORDER DISCOUNTS are available for those making several purchases of items of merchandise, whether they are all the same item or different items and  whether they are constructed from matching fabrics or different fabrics.  \r\n\r\n*****BRIDES!  For those Brides who are making a purchase of five or more items for their bridal party, Dollbirdies will combine appropriate shipping cost for the items and give a 10% discount on the total for the items purchased as long as the items are identical and constructed with the same fabrics. **There can be no discounts for Brides who choose to either combine items or who choose to purchase identical items but want the items to be constructed with multiple companion prints or coordinating prints.\r\n\r\n** I would like for my customers to please respect my policies and understand that I am not a part-time craft person. I do not run Dollbirdies for &quot;fun&quot; or to &quot;amuse&quot; myself in my spare time or for &quot;extra cash.&quot; I am a full time business woman who has chosen to work from home in order to support my family. I have been merchandising my hand crafted items for over thirty years through various venues. The quality of my merchandise is important to me as is my business reputation. Through Dollbirdies, I offer to the public, quality merchandise at a fair price. Dollbirdies is not open for business to haggle, to barter, or to exchange goods. Like everyone else, I work hard in order to pay my bills and support the people I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\nCarefully note all laundry suggestions for Dollbirdies merchandise. It is impossible to launder some bags because of their hardware, even though the materials used in construction are machine washable. To extend the life of each Dollbirdie bag and to cut out unnecessary laundering, it is suggested upon receipt of the item to Scotch Guard it. If you find it necessary to launder your item Dollbirdies recommends spot cleaning or hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, air drying the item, and steam ironing any wrinkles. However, unless the fabric has been noted as &quot;dry clean only&quot;, a bag can be, if absolutely necessary, laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle with mild detergents and removed from the machine before the spin cycle. Gently squeeze out all the water that you possibly can and then allow machine laundered bags to drip and air dry as much as possible. (If you must machine dry your bag do so on the lowest heat setting on your machine to remove any remaining excess water and to reduce shrinkage.) Allowing items to air dry is best, followed by steam pressing. Wrinkles can be removed best by the use of a steam iron. Always remove any hard bottom from a bag before laundering. Do not launder any hard bottom. All batting used in construction of padded Dollbirdies bags, aside from insulbright used in insulated lunch totes, is 100% cotton and will shrink when laundered and dried in a machine.",
